weight loss (wl) differences between iso caloric high-carbohydrate and high-fat
diets are generally small; however, indi vidual wl varies within diet groups.
genotype patterns may modify diet effect s, with carbohydrate-responsive gen-
otypes losing more weight on high-carbohydrate diets (and vice versa for fat-responsive genotypes). we investigate d whether 12-week wl (kg, primary out-
come) differs between genotype-concor dant and genotype-discordant diets. in
this 12-week single-center wl trial, 14 5 participants with overweight/obesity
were identi fied a priori as fat-responders or carbohydrate-responders based on
their combined genotypes at ten genetic variants and randomized to a high-fat
(n = 73) or high-carbohydrate diet (n = 72), yielding 4 groups: (1) fat-respondersreceiving high-fat diet, (2) fat-responders receiving high-carbohydrate diet, (3)carbohydrate-responders receiving high-fat diet, (4) carbohydrate-respondersreceiving high-carbohydrate diet. dietitians delivered the wl intervention via 12weekly diet-speci fic small group sessions. outcome assessors were blind to diet
assignment and genotype patterns. we included 122 participants (54.4 [sd:13.2]years, bmi 34.9 [sd:5.1] kg/m
2, 84% women) in the analyses. twelve-week wl did
not differ between the genotype-concordant ( −5.3 kg [sd:1.0]) and genotype-
discordant diets ( −4.8 kg [sd:1.1]; adjusted difference: −0.6 kg [95% ci: −2.1,0.9],
p= 0.50). with the current ability to geno type participants as fat- or carbohy-
drate-responders, evidence does not support greater wl on genotype-concordant diets. clinicaltrials identi fier: nct04145466.
the 2017 –2018 national health and nutrition examination survey
(nhanes) showed that almost 43% of us adults aged 20 and over haveobesity, including 9.0% with severe obesity, and another 31% areoverweight

approach of determining low-fat- and low-carbohydrate-responsivegenotypes based on single-nucle otide polymorphisms (snps) from
three genes ( pparg ,adrb2 ,a n d fabp2 )
8,9has been criticized10.o v e r a l l ,
reports show that most genotype × diet interactions are not signi ficant,
and replication is rare11. a more comprehensive and informative risk
score (determined a priori), comprised of a greater number of snpswith demonstrated and validated effects on the responses to high-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, may better de fine fat- and carbohydrate-
responsive genetic predisposition scores.
the present rct tested the hypothesis that participants assigned
to a diet corresponding to their a priori-determined (fat-responsive or
carbohydrate-responsive) genotype would lose more weight over
12 weeks than those assigned to a diet discordant with their genotype.further, we aimed to analyze those with a fat-responsive genotype(subsequently “fat-responders ”) and carbohydrate-responsive geno-
type (subsequently “carbohydrate-responders ”) separately. we hypo-
thesized that (1) fat-responders would lose more weight on the high-fatvs. high-carbohydrate diet and conversely (2) carbohydrate-responders would lose more weight on the high-carbohydrate vs.high-fat diet. a secondary objective of the present rct was to test thenewly-developed genetic risk score to determine fat- andcarbohydrate-responsive genotypes that was based on the current

results
figure 1shows the flow of participants through the study. of the
2082 participants who screened for the study, 305 were eligiblefollowing the web/phone screen and were invited to the orientationvisit. after eligibility veri fication based on medical history, medica-
tion inventory, and physical measures, 275 remained and completeda genealogy test. of these 275 individuals, 106 (~39%) were excludedbecause they had a genotype that was classi fied as responsive to
neither a high-fat nor a high-carbohydrate diet or as responsive toboth diets. of the remaining 169 individuals, 112 (~41%) were fat-
responders, and 57 (~20%) were carbohydrate-responders. before the
baseline visit (completed by 152 participants), 17 participants wereexcluded because we either lost contact between the orientation visitand the baseline visit ( n= 13) or because participants changed their
minds about willingness to participate ( n= 4). following the baseline
visit, 7 additional participants were excluded due to elevated glucoselevels ( n= 5) or lost contact ( n= 2). of the 145 participants rando-
mized, 16 were lost to follow-up (w12), and 129 completed the trial.seven participants were excluded from the analyses because theywere incorrectly genotyped and erroneously enrolled ( n= 5; removal
from dataset suggested by irb) or failed to provide weight data at
w12 ( n= 2). baseline characteristics of all 122 included participants(54.4 [sd: 13.2] years, bmi 34.9 [sd: 5.1] kg/m

adherence to the assigned diets is shown in 
difficulties in obtaining the adherence data from participants due, in
part, to the pandemic and needing to move to remote interventiondelivery. consequently, these adherence data are only available for 22of 57 participants (39%) on the high-carbohydrate diet and for 43 of 65participants (66%) on the high-fat diet (the discrepancy in the percentcomplete/missing is noted, though we have no reason to believe that itwas systematic). on average, participants on the high-carbohydratediet reported consuming 63.4% (sd: 2.3) of their energy from carbo-hydrates (target 65%), 20.9% (sd: 2.4) from fat (target 20%), and 16.0%(sd: 1.0) from protein (target 15%) in week 4, 63.3% (sd: 2.8) fromcarbohydrates, 20.5% (sd: 1.7) from fat, and 15.9% (sd: 1.0) from pro-
tein in week 8, and 62.7% (sd: 4.0) from carbohydrates, 20.5% (sd: 2.5)
from fat, and 15.7% (sd: 1.8) from protein in week 12. participants onthe high-fat diet reported consuming on average 45.4% (sd: 2.2) oftheir energy from carbohydrates (target 45%), 39.4% (sd: 2.0) from fat(target 40%), and 15.8% (sd: 1.2) from protein (target 15%) in week 4,44.7% (sd: 2.2) from carbohydrates, 40.5% (sd: 2.1) from fat, and 15.7%(sd: 2.3) from protein in week 8, and 44.5% (sd: 3.4) from carbohy-drates, 39.9% (sd: 2.5) from fat, and 16.1% (sd: 3.3) from protein inweek 12.
session attendance and adverse events
weekly attendance was similar across the four genotype-diet groups
(supplementary table 9), with weekly session attendance ranging
from 85% to 100%. there were 4 adverse or serious adverse events intotal. two adverse events occurred among fat-responders on a high-carbohydrate diet (unrelated to the study), and there were 2 seriousadverse events (1 among fat-responders on a high-carbohydrate diet, 1among fat-responders on a high-fat diet) that required hospitalization
(unrelated to study).
discussion
the present rct determined the participant ’s (fat-responsive or car-
bohydrate-responsive) genotype a priori via a comprehensive geneticrisk score based on published and validated effects and tested theeffects of a genotype-concordant diet on wl over 12 weeks. we foundno difference in wl between individuals on the genotype-concordantvs. genotype-discordant diet. further, insulin levels or homa-ir werenot associated with wl. food cravings tended to decrease amongcarbohydrate-responders on a high-fat diet compared to those on ahigh-carbohydrate diet. finally, fat-responders on a high-carbohydrate
diet tended to decrease resting sbp.
the lack of signi ficant and clinically meaningful differences in wl
(~0.6 kg) between genotype-concordant and genotype-discordantdiets aligns with the literature

based on an algorithm involving 10 s nps. supported by a recent-meta-

that with the current ability to genotype individuals as fat or carbo-hydrate-responders, there is no evidence that genotype-concordant
diets result in greater wl.
our sample consisted of substantially fewer carbohydrate-
responders ( n= 37) than fat-responders ( n= 85). we did not limit

pleted a genealogy test, of which ~39% had a genotype classi fied as
responsive to both or neither of the t wo diets, ~41% were fat-responders
and ~20% were carbohydrate-respond ers. notably, these numbers are
somewhat different fr om what we had estimated during the study ’s
planning phase, as we expected 1/3 of people to be fat-responders, 1/3carbohydrate-responders, and 1/3 to respond to neither or both of the
speci fied diets. future studies with larger samples should verify if this
uneven distribution between car bohydrate-responders and fat-
responders is representative of th e general population and further
investigate the potential effect on wl among carbohydrate-responders.
future studies could also consider assigning participants to
genotype-concordant diets without speci fic energy intake targets and
examine the diet effects not only on wl but also on cardiovascular riskfactors. previously, a low-carbohydrate diet without energy intaketarget resulted in greater improvements in body composition, bloodlipids, and estimated 10-year coronary heart disease risk compared to alow-fat diet
19. it would be insightful to investigate whether genotype
plays a role in cardiovascular risk reduction following a low-carbohydrate vs. low-fat diet without calorie restriction.
fasting insulin levels and homa-ir did not predict wl. previous
studies reporting a diet × fasting insulin interaction for wl found lowercarbohydrate diets to be superior for individuals with greater insulinresistance
13and high baseline insulin secretion (30 min after a 75 g oral
glucose tolerance test)20, presumably due to a reduced burden on
insulin-mediated glucose disposal. however, these studies involvedrelatively small sample sizes, and findings of the in fluence of insulin
sensitivity
21and insulin secretion9,14on wl via a low-fat vs. a low-
carbohydrate diet are inconsistent.wl can reduce food cravings, particularly for foods restricted on
speci ficd i e t s22, contributing to the hypothesis that food cravings are a
conditioned expression of hunger due to stimuli paired with eatingcertain foods
23. consequently, cravings can be reduced by eliminating
or restricting the intake of craved foods. this hypothesis is partiallysupported by our results as, among carbohydrate-responders, crav-ings tended to decrease for high-carbohydrate foods on the high-fatdiet. nonetheless, cravings also decreased modestly for high-fat foods,which is to be expected as the amount of all foods was restricted, andcravings for speci fic foods correlate with each other

among fat-responders, a high-carbohydrate diet tended to
decrease resting sbp. nonetheless, these individuals had the highest
mean sbp of the 4 genotype-diet groups at baseline. thus, this effect
could be explained, in whole or partially, by regression to the mean.also, all 4 genotype-diet groups had relatively well-controlledblood pressure, leaving little room for improvement through dietarychanges, making the non-signi ficant improvements potentially more
meaningful.
this trial has some limitations. first, the genetic algorithm
to classify individuals as fat- or carbohydrate-responders was createdbased on published literature
25–38. however, these (mostly retro-
spective) studies generally had modest sample sizes, and some ofthe genotype × diet interactions, which may be false positives, havenot been independently replicated. further, wl is determined by
multiple modi fiable and non-modi fiable (e.g., genetic) factors,
and current knowledge accounts for a small percentage of thevariability. further genotypes may have in fluenced participants ’wl
responses in directions different from those predicted from themeasured genotypes. more comprehensive knowledge of the role offig. 3 | change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure during the 12-week

nature communications | (2023) 14:6321 6genetics in wl is needed and should be obtained from genome-wide
association studies; however, the sample size and experimentaldesign required to generate that essential information are beyondreach at this time. additional limitations of the present study includethe relatively small sample size, single-center design, and short timeframe. a longer timeframe (6 –12-month follow-up) may have
increased the amount and differential weight loss between diets. a
larger sample size might have also allowed for detecting differencesin clinically important secondary outcomes such as changes inbody fat and sbp. further, we did not provide meals in thisstudy, which may have affected dietary adherence (high-fat vs.high-carbohydrate). however, this choice was made by design, as ourstudy was designed as a (pragmatic) effectiveness trial with real-world conditions rather than an ef ficacy trial. additionally, the
adherence data (albeit limited) suggests that diet adherence wasoverall satisfactory. in addition to assessing diet adherence con-tinuously throughout the study, future studies should also assess themacronutrient composition of participants ’habitual diets to see
any differences in the magnitude of the shifts from baseline to the
high-fat or high-carbohydrate diet. further, when assessing apotential effect modi fication by insulin resistance status, using an
oral glucose tolerance test (auc or ins-30) rather than homa-ir toquantify insulin resistance might have been a better option, ashoma-ir has limited sensitivity due to its reliance on fasting insulin
and glucose levels and it does not re flect differences between tissues
(e.g., adipose, muscle) or postprandial physiology. non-fastingmethods yield greater variability of the glucose/insulin dynamicsand may have been more suitable. additionally, the assessment ofpercent body fat via bia is a limitation as bia does not provide
information on body fat distribution. finally, participation in “nutri-
genomics ”studies generally induces improved diet adherence
39–42,
independent of the speci fic recommendations. therefore, in our
study, participants may have responded better to their assigned dietsregardless of their genotype matching, obscuring the speci ficn u t r i -
genomics effects.
in conclusion, in this 12-week rct, there was no difference in wl
between individuals with an a priori determined fat- or carbohydrate-responsive genotype on a high-carbohydrate vs. high-fat diet withspeci fic energy targets and the same level of energy restriction
across diets.

after enrollment (week [w] 0 visit), participants were randomized toeither a high-carbohydrate diet (rich in whole-grain foods) or a high-fatdiet (rich in unsaturated fats/oils). the high-carbohydrate diet con-sisted of ~20% of energy from fat and ~65% from carbohydrates,whereas the high-fat diet consisted of ~40% energy from fat and ~45%from carbohydrates. both diets provided 15% of energy from protein.all participants were assigned an energy intake target that would resultin a daily de ficit of ~750 kcal and provided with a diet-speci ficm e a lp l a n
in 200 kcal increments from 1400 to 2800 kcal/day to self-preparemeals during the intervention period. to facilitate meal plan adher-
ence when preparing or selecting meals, the meal plans included a list
of ingredients (and their amounts) for all meals of each day (breakfast,lunch, dinner, and 1 daily snack) and instructions for meal preparationand participants were provided a food scale. baseline energy require-ments were calculated with mif flin-st. jeor ’sf o r m u l a s

sequence using sas 9.4 statistical software for windows (sas institute,cary, nc) and uploaded it to redcap (research electronic datacapture). redcap used strata for the inaction of genotype and gender.to ensure a relatively equal baseline bmi between the 4 genotype-dietgroups, a 1:1 randomization scheme was devised that adjusted forbmi, gender, and genotype. gender and genotype were used as strata,while bmi was used in an a-priori-created randomization equation.within each stratum, this equation used block sizes of 6 (for females)and 4 (for males) at the start of the study and ended with block sizes
of 4 and 2, respectively, to ensure relative balance of group assign-
ments. block sizes were assigned during the study by the biostatisti-cian with access only to information about the enrolment progress(percent enrolled).

statistical analyses
the distribution of variables was evaluated by visual examination andthe shapiro-wilk test. the primary outcome was weight change (kg) at12 weeks. all other measures were secondary endpoints. changes inoutcomes are presented as mean and 95% con fidence intervals (ci). we
used linear mixed models to determine if changes in outcome vari-
ables differed among diets. covariates in the models included baseline
value of the outcome, sex, and race. the mixed-effect model accoun-ted for the correlation of the subject over time, and least-square means
based on the estimate from the mixed-effect model were used to testfor differences in weight change between diets. to evaluate whethertable 6 | change in intervention satisfaction (post-intervention) in those assigned to a diet concordant vs. discordant with the

abstr act
the current health status of the general public can substantially benef it from a health y diet. using a personalized approach to
initiate health y dietary behavior seems to be a promising strate gy, as individuals differ in terms of health status, subsequent dietary
needs, and their desired behavior change support. however, providing personalized advice to a wide audience over a long period
is very labor -intensi ve. this bottleneck can possibly be overcome by digitalizing the process of creating and providing personalized
advice. an increasing number of personalized advice systems for different purposes is becoming available in the mark et, ranging
from systems providing advice about just a single parameter to very comple x systems that include many variables characterizing
each individual situation. scientif ic background is often lacking in these systems. in designing a personalized nutrition advice
system, many design questions need to be answered, ranging from the required input parameters and accurate measurement
methods (sense), type of modeling techniques to be used (reason), and modality in which the personalized advice is provided
(act). we have addressed these topics in this viewpoint paper , and we have demonstrated the feasibility of setting up an infrastructure
for providing personalized dietary advice based on the experience of 2 practical applications in a real-life setting.

introduction
backgr ound
sufficient physical activity and a health y diet are known to
substantially contrib ute to the prevention of chronic diseases
and obesity [1-4]. the increasing burden of chronic diseases,
including diabetes, cardio vascular diseases, and obesity ,
highlights the importance of promoting a health y lifestyle [5-7].
dietary and physical activity guidelines have been developed
for the general population with the aim to prevent or delay the
onset of chronic diseases. however, only a limited number of
people adhere to the general guidelines for health y dietary intak e
and physical activity [8-12]. in addition, these general guidelinesare mostly one size fits alland disre gard differences between
individuals in terms of biology , behavior, genetics, and the
sociopsychological environment [13,14]. therefore, it has been
hypothesized that personalized approaches may be more
effective in changing lifestyle parameters such as diet, sleep,
stress, and physical activity . here, we focus on nutrition.
personalized nutrition
the overall goal of personalized nutrition approaches is to
promote or maintain health status of an individual by using
personal data to tailor dietary recommendations or services to
fit their specif ic needs . personalized nutrition has been
defined as approaches that “use individual-specif ic information,
founded in evidence-based science, to promote dietary behavior

renderxchange that may result in measurable health benef its” .
studies have shown that such personalized approaches are more
effective in impro ving dietary behavior as compared with
generic information [18-24]. these personalized nutrition
approaches can use the knowledge that individuals may show
a differential physiological response to nutrients, foods, or
dietary patterns [25,26] but may also be primarily focused on
individual (dietary) behavior, preferences, and goals [16,18].
several factors could explain the high effectiveness of a
personalized approach. first, the advice itself is tailored to the
individual’ s constitution and preferences and therefore may be
expected to be more effective than generic advice; in other
words, if personal data are used for generating evidence-based
dietary recommendations, they are more likely to result in health
benef its as compared with dietary recommendations based on
population data [13,27]. second, information that is percei ved
as more relevant by an individual is more likely to recei ve
attention, thereby increasing the impact of the information and
the feeling of involvement of an individual [27,28].
personalized nutrition advice systems
it becomes apparent from the variety of studies performed so
far [26,29-32] that personalized advice covers many ways of
personalization, ranging from personalization based on a single
nutrient (eg, salt intak e and sodium status) to comple x systems
including a multitude of measurements and associated
recommendations. in addition, the mode of delivery for
personalized nutrition may vary, including personalized
coaching by a dietician, personalized meal services, and
personalized recommender systems such as apps or platforms
or combinations thereof . in this paper , we focused on the
development and implementation of digital personalized
nutrition advice systems (pnass), in which the translation of
individual data into a personalized service is digitalized and
(partly) automated. such pnass contain 3 common
components:
•sensing part, which is made up of the input parameters that
are used, such as biomark ers, behavioral data, or genetic
information
•reasoning part, which translates the input parameters into
an advice using knowledge rules such as scientif ically
substantiated food-health relations
•acting part, where the advice is communicated to the
consumer with the aim to help them move toward more
health y habits [16,34]
this is also consistent with berezo wska et al , who state
that pnass typically consist of three information process stages
forming a feedback loop, describing the relation between a
service providing personalized dietary advice (eg, provider of
a dietary advice app) and the user of that service: (1) an
individual user first provides their personal information, (2) this
information is processed to obtain a personalized advice, and
(3) it is then communicated to the user of the service. it is clear
that during the development of a digital personalized advice
system, a multitude of design choices need to be made on these
3 levels. a schematic overvie w of a pnas, including possible
measurement platforms for the sensing part, possible modalitiesfor the acting part, and examples of potential target groups is
provided by adams et al .
development of a pnas and application in 2 use cases
in this paper , we have described the rationale behind the design
choices made in developing our pnas. this pnas was
developed as part of the public private partnership personalized
nutrition and health, in which the netherlands organisation
for applied scientif ic research and wageningen university
and research work together with private parties . we aimed
at developing a science-based, dynamic pnas that could be
used in different target groups. to test the pnas, 2 use cases
were defined, one aiming at consumers with premetabolic
syndrome motivated to change their diets to enhance their health
(ie, highly motivated consumers; n=37) and the other aiming
at consumers with a low socioeconomic status (n=96). the
pnas had to have a generic backbone but be able to handle
different sets of input and output parameters. a digitalized
pnas that was suitable for use in these 2 use cases was
developed and tested using 2 human studies [37,38].
this paper discusses the 3 generic components in
pnass—sensing, reasoning, and acting in general—and the
design choices that were made for sensing, reasoning, and acting
for our pnas in the 2 use cases. first, we expand on the possible
input parameters that can be used for sensing, including their
caveats. regarding reasoning, we will discuss how
evidence-based food-health relations can be incorporated into
a digital system and about the modeling strate gies that we used.
regarding acting, the focus is on the communication of feedback
(health and dietary status) and advice (dietary recommendations)
and the use of behavior change techniques for activating
consumers.
sensing—p ersonal data
overview
when the main goal and target group of the pnas are clear ,
the first step in the designing process is to decide on input or
sensing parameters that can and should be included. there is a
wide variety of possible parameters, including clinical measures,
behavior, well-being, genetics, personal preferences, and so on
. broadly , 2 categories of relevant data for personalization
can be distinguished, namely , biological characteristics and data
related to current behavior, preferences, barriers, and objecti ves
. to decide which sensing parameters to include in your
pnas, decisions need to be made about the scope of your
system, for example, what aspects of health are relevant; which
measurements are feasible; and what parameters need to be
included to measure the success of your pnas, for instance, in
impro ving the health status or well-being of consumers .
for our pnas, we decided to include both biological
characteristics or health parameter sand parameters related to
current lifestyle behavior, which are further described in the
following sections.
health parameters
to decide which health parameters to include in your system,
it is important to consider what aspects of health are influenced

renderxby nutrition and how these can be measured. the concept of
health used to be defined as a state of complete mental, physical,
and social well-being . however, currently , a more holistic
approach is accepted, in which there is also a role for an
individual’ s ability to cope with daily challenges . the
physical dimension of health, represented by the body and its
overall functionality , covers a broad scope ranging from the
absence of disease to the level of physical fitness. classical
physical health in a pharmacological or clinical setting is
determined by the phenotype . the phenotype is often assessed
by benchmarking anthropometric measurements and single
overnight fasting plasma biomark ers against cutof f values that
represent either a healthy or compr omised status. currently ,
health is considered as the body’ s ability to adapt to (changing)
circumstances, while remaining within homeostatic boundaries
. this definition calls for alternati ve assessment methods
that operationalize health by capturing the body’ s systemic
response to (challenging) circumstances, instead of a single
measurement such as fasting glucose . when only clinical
cutof fs are considered, subtle changes in overall health status
may be overlook ed. therefore, the integration of multiple
measured biomark ers or phenotypic traits is key. for this
purpose, a so-called health space model can be used, which
combines multiple biomark ers into a single score using
multi variate statistical methods and data from reference
populations [42,43].
the first step for incorporating health in a pnas is to determine
which phenotypic health parameters provide a good
representation of the health status of a person and may provide
the opportunity for personalized advice. in the simplest sense,
parameters such as sex, age, and anthropometrics can be used,
but often, more specif ic and clinical measurements (ie, plasma
biochemical mark ers and vitals) and genotypic data are included
to provide a more holistic overvie w of health. all measurements
should be accurate, valid, and preferably relati vely easy to
obtain.
in our system, basic characteristics such as age and sex were
combined with easy-to-measure anthropometrics and vitals such
as body weight, blood pressure, body length, and waist
circumference. depending on the target population and the
setting of the investig ation, the set of measurements was either
extended or reduced. one of our studies was performed with
highly motivated consumers in a health care setting. therefore,
participants could be easily called to the clinic, which allowed
for more extensi ve anthropometric measurements (eg, fat
percentage) and the collection of blood samples for measuring
plasma biomark ers (high-density lipoprotein [hdl] cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein [ldl] cholesterol, glucose, and
triglycerides and a nutrient profile). the other study with
consumers with low socioeconomic status was set in a
supermark et, which asks for easy-to-perform measurements
with direct readouts. in such a setting, do-it-yourself
measurements can be applied, such as body weight scales, blood
pressure meters, and handheld devices for plasma biomark ers.
in addition, wearables and apps could provide a good solution
for assessment in a more do-it-yourself setting but were not part
of our studies. the measurements to be included in a pnas are
also dependent on the target group. highly motivated individualswere more willing to accept blood sampling to be able to
recei ve more detailed personal advice, as compared with those
with low socioeconomic status who were less interested in
nutrition-related solutions for health .
lifestyle beha vior parameters
in principle, a complete set of health parameters only, with
sufficiently accurate values, could suffice in providing a
personalized advice. however, in addition to the physical
dimension of health, lifestyle, mental, and socioen vironmental
factors influence health status, for example, food intak e, physical
exercise, stress, physical environment, and social support
netw orks. knowledge about an individual’ s current lifestyle
will have added value in several ways. first, the set of health
parameters is not sufficiently rich to cover all required aspects.
second, relations between lifestyle behavior and health status
are not fully known, and this for instance limits the number of
nutrients, foods, or food groups for which recommendations
can be formulated . providing personalized
recommendations relati ve to current food intak e behavior can
help to fill these gaps and enrich the personalized advice;
however, the recommendations themselv es will be based on
population-based cutof f values. third, to some extent, current
lifestyle behavior can also serve as a proxy for health status
. finally , integrating current lifestyle behavior into
personalized advice could increase the relevance of
recommendations to match individuals’ current behavior, and
their habits and preferences, for instance, current physical
activity patterns, can be incorporated . overall, two main
approaches can be distinguished for the measurement of lifestyle
behavior, namely (1) monitoring current lifestyle and (2)
self-reporting on lifestyle behavior [45,46]. monitoring can be
performed using sensors and mobile apps, such as an activity
track er or a sleep monitor . self-reporting mostly relies on
questionnaires, which vary in the level of obtained detail and
validity .
in our system, in terms of lifestyle, we focused on dietary intak e.
for measuring dietary intak e over a period, several self-reporting
measurement methods are available, including (1) food
frequenc y questionnaires, which are commonly used to provide
a quantitati ve measure of nutrient level; (2) food diaries or
dietary recalls, which provide a quantitati ve output on nutrient
level and product level; and (3) health y eating indexes, which
provide a more qualitati ve output in terms of overall healthiness
of the diet [47-49]. however, these conventional tools for
measuring dietary behavior have major limitations. they are
subject to overreporting and underreporting, dependent on the
willingness of a user to log their dietary intak e and the quality
and details of the underlying food composition databases
[47-49]. as an alternati ve approach, nutrient profiling in blood
could be considered to capture dietary intak e. this would
include plasma levels of specif ic vitamins and minerals or
metabolites as a proxy for dietary status [50,51]. in addition, a
few biomark ers that can reflect dietary intak e on a food-group
level exist, for example, alkylresorcinols for whole grain intak e,
lipid profiling for fish intak e, and a combination of carotenoids
and vitamins for fruit and vegetable intak e [52,53].
unfortunately , most of these biomark er levels reflect long-term
dietary behavior rather than short-term food intak e; in contrast,
j med internet res 2023 | vol. 25 | e37667 | p. 3 https://www .jmir.org/2023/1/e37667

xsl•fo
renderxmany metabolites have a short half-life and thus are not
representati ve of habitual intak e . in addition, currently ,
biomark ers do not provide a complete picture of an individual’ s
dietary intak e. however, combining biomark ers with more
classical approachessuch as food diaries and questionnaires
may result in a more accurate assessment of dietary intak e .
another approach to assess dietary intak e is to use a diet quality
index to assess adherence to a specif ic dietary pattern, such as
the health y eating index and the mediterranean diet adherence
screener [54,55]. such diet quality indexes are based on
population-based dietary guidelines and provide insight into
the overall diet quality and conformance with recommended
intak es of specif ic food groups that are key to a health y diet. in
addition, combinations of dietary assessment methods can be
used.
as our studies were set in the netherlands, for our system, we
used the dutch health y eating index (dhei) questionnaire.
the dhei includes a set of 15 categories or food groups ,
consists of a relati vely simple list of questions that can be
answered in a short time frame, and results in a score ranging
from 0 to 10 for the 15 food groups and an overall diet quality
score [56,57]. the reason for using this dietary assessment
method is that we are not very interested in obtaining the exact
intak e of macronutrients and micronutrients by individuals but
merely in whether individuals comply with dietary guidelines
at a food-group level as a first step toward personalization.
using food groups for personalized advice instead of nutrients
has several advantages: (1) focusing on food groups is more
consistent with the shift in the dutch dietary guidelines from
single nutrients to food groups ; (2) both evidence-based
relations between food groups and health parameters and
between nutrients and health parameters can be incorporated in
the system, using specif ic nutrients to further fine-tune the
advice [59,60]; and (3) feedback and advice are easily applicable
as consumers do not have to identify which foods are high in
the recommended nutrients themselv es. the disadv antage of
using dhei is that no information on the consumption of
specif ic food products or the amount of macronutrients and
micronutrients consumed can be obtained . in addition, the
dhei provides output on a qualitati ve level, not quantitati ve;
for instance, the dhei does not provide insight into the exact
amount of vegetables consumed (in grams). the dhei is based
on population-based dietary guidelines and can be used for
distinguishing between categories ranging from health y to
unhealth y dietary behaviors for the included food groups. such
a subdi vision can be used for personalizing dietary
recommendations based on current dietary intak e patterns. to
further personalize the recommendations, this output can be
combined with other parameters, such as health status mark ers,
as described in the previous paragraph, which we applied in our
pnas.
reasoning—advice model
overview
from the abovementioned arguments, it follows that 3 basic
design choices have to be made when developing digital systems
for personal dietary advice:•first, the health condition of an individual should be used
as the actual variable to control. health parameters are
monitored, and their values are used to decide which aspect
of dietary intak e should be focused on [16,27]. this requires
a model that maps health parameter values to nutrients,
foods, or food categories that need attention. this model
should be based on science-based relations between dietary
intak e and health impact .
•second, current individual food intak e should be considered
as a starting point for an individual path toward health y
intak e, rather than directly pointing to the optimal diet.
eating patterns cannot be changed at will; habits are difficult
to change . therefore, we do not assess products in
terms of healthy or not healthy for a representative
population but analyze eating habits in terms of deficiencies
or gaps with respect to the ideal situation . for our
system, we decided that measuring food intak e at the
category level was sufficient.
•third, in principle, personal preference, motivation, and
situation have to be taken into account to ensure compliance
with the generated advice . in this study , this was
limited to asking consumers to self-select which food
category to focus on and to formulate implementation
intentions for these, with the latter being a behavior change
technique facilitating actual behavior change (refer to the
behavior chang e techniques section).
these design choices give rise to 2 questions. how can we create
a softw are-based model that generates a personal advice, and
how can we combine food intak e data with health data in this
model? in the following sections, we address the modeling
approaches that we used for our pnas, knowledge acquisition
as a basis for an expert-dri ven model, and composing
personalized advice in a flexible manner .
modeling approach
for creating a model that links the observ ed health variables
(such as blood pressure, ldl cholesterol level, and bmi) to
food categories that need attention, ideally , we start from
scientif ic publications and reports. however, constructing
softw are models from scientif ic papers is a complicated and
time-consuming process. in practice, we assume that dietary
professionals already have operationalized this knowledge. for
our system, we have applied knowledge acquisition methods
from information science to develop the required softw are
models. we consulted nutrition experts to informally describe
the heuristics they use in practice in the form of, for example,
a text file or a spreadsheet. they also provide pointers to the
underlying scientif ic evidence. this process of mining expert
knowledge results in many knowledge rules. these rules
can be expressed as decision trees or, more flexibly , as logical
knowledge rules. however, for our system, we have selected
bayesian belief netw orks (bbns) to express the relation
between the observ ed health parameters and suggested changes
in diet (ie, advice).
bbn is a probabilistic model that represents a set of variables
and their conditional dependencies using a directed graph. the
advantage of this approach is that tools are available to start
with an initial qualitati ve influence diagram and then

xsl•fo
renderxprogressi vely add quantitati ve details. the experts can then
evaluate the overall effect of the combined heuristics they
provided by running the reasoning capabilities of the netw ork
and verify the predictions made.
in our case, the netw ork represents the probabilistic relationships
between health variables (input) and advice variables (output).
each of the parameters in our model has several discrete values
(states); for example, for the input parameter systolic blood
pressure, we used the values 90 to 110, 110 to 129, and 130 to
250. each state in the outputs refers to a text fragment that is
provided to the consumer , for example, “no_advice, ”
“high-blood-pressure_eat_suf ficient_v egetables, ” and
“enrich_with_nuts. ” the links between the input and output
parameters express the probability that the state of one parameter
leads to a certain state of the other parameter , expressed as
percentage. in our current model, we assume that if each of the
input parameters is in a single state (ie, this state has a
probability of 100% and the other has 0%), then each of the
output parameters is also in a single state. however, the strength
of bbns is that they permit a distrib ution of probabilities over
multiple states, allowing uncertainty in the inputs and outputs.
for example, if bmi is unkno wn and the probability of high
waist circumference is 45%, there is a 10% chance that no
advice is needed regarding vegetable intak e. however,
determining these probability values manually is very difficult
and considered as future research.
an important advantage of the bbn is the fact that it is possible
to combine explicit expert heuristics with additional
observ ational data as knowledge sources to compute probability
values or even create the netw ork itself. once we have collected
enough data from observ ations regarding how dietary advice
parameters have influenced the health parameters, it is possible
to trainthe model with these data and automatically adapt the
probability tables. in this study , the amount of data collected
was not sufficient to perform this next step.
knowledge acquisition
the process of knowledge acquisition involves several rounds
of intervie ws with dietary experts and systematic record keeping,
in which domain experts and knowledge engineers work
together . such a process often reveals hidden assumptions,
differences in terminology , and contro versies among experts.
overall, 2 methods can be used to resolv e such issues:
confr ontation among experts and relating to underlying science .
a typical issue in knowledge acquisition that often raises debate
among experts arises from conflicting classif ications. for
example, the general dutch guidelines use the category, bread,
for a range of products and provide cutof f values for health y
consumption. however, some food intak e apps use the category,
whole grain product , for different types of products such as
bread, pasta, and rice. how should we then classify whole grain
bread? this type of semantic discussion among experts can
often be resolv ed by applying appropriate modeling practices.
in this case, breadcan be used as a class, defining a group of
products that use similar ingredients and preparation methods.
in contrast, the concept, whole grain, indicates that a product
is produced from whole grains, which should be expressed by
the property , “is_produced_from, ” rather than by defining adistinct class , whole grain products . in this way, whole grain
breadis a type of bread, with property , “is_produced_from =
whole_grain. ” another interesting but confusing category is the
notion of unhealthy product , in particular , in the conte xt of
personalized advice. by assigning food products as instances
of this predef ined class, we assume that these products are
unhealth y for anyone in any situation. this contradicts with the
idea that what is health y depends on the individual, their entire
dietary pattern, and their conte xt and should therefore be
modeled as a (derived) property rather than a class .
for the second approach to solving knowledge conflicts, that
is, relating to underlying science , the experts were asked to
select relevant publications to support the heuristics they
expressed. this is certainly not a straightforw ard task. in
food-health research, scientif ic studies often use nutritional
values as input variables, as these basic metabolic and
physiologic mechanisms are often known. however, relations
expressing the impact of entire foods and dietary patterns on
health are also needed, as these take nutrients in a food matrix
and interactions between foods into account. these 2 different
approaches (nutritional values vs food categories and diets) also
need to be reflected in the knowledge rules that are used in
individual advice. in our study , we have chosen to stay at the
level of food categories and have the experts decide on how
nutrient-le vel evidence is incorporated. for example, for some
categories, we know that they are typically high in a particular
nutrient (eg, omega-3 fatty acids in fish). in this case, we can
use the evidence at the nutrient level for the associated food
category. in addition, we have used nutrient-health relations to
elaborate the final advisory texts. for example, we recommend
types of fruit that are high in fiber for people with high blood
pressure, as fiber can help to reduce blood pressure.
finally , the experts also needed to decide whether the conditions
under which the underlying studies were originally performed
can be generalized to our system and target groups. as our
system is developed for use in the netherlands, for instance,
evidence from meta-analysis on food-health relations in the
asian population was excluded . in addition, the level of
evidence and quality of the research should be considered, for
instance, using the grading of recommendations, assessment,
development, and evaluations method . regarding our
knowledge rules, we used evidence as given by the dutch health
council, which applies a thorough but time-consuming literature
review process to translate observ ed health effects in cohort
studies to generalized rules for the impact of food categories
on health, as a basis. we extended this basic set with rules
derived from more recent literature and additional publications
covering health parameters that were not within the scope of
the dutch health council (eg, glucose, triglycerides, and hdl
cholesterol levels and waist circumference). an example of the
latter is a meta-analysis showing the benef icial effects of whole
grain consumption on blood glucose levels and risk of type 2
diabetes [66-68]. the additional knowledge rules that were
added to our system also include food-health relations as
accepted for health claims by the european food safety
authority , based on evidence from a recent meta-analysis.

renderxcomposing the advice
in this section, we explain in more detail how we algorithmically
combined health parameters and food intak e measurements to
create a composite personal advice.
first, the input nodes of bbn were defined as the amount of
intak e for the categories used in the dhei questionnaire (ie,
vegetables, fruit, whole grain products, salt, fish, dairy ,
sugar-containing beverages, butter, nuts, coffee, alcohol, and
unhealth y snacks) and the values of several health parameters
(ie, bmi, waist circumference, diastolic and systolic bloodpressure, glucose, triglycerides, ldl, hdl, carotenoids,
alkylresorcinols, and omega-3 fatty acids index). second, the
output nodes for the netw ork were then broken down into
separate advice texts at 4 levels(textbox 1).
then, bbn connects the input nodes to the output nodes,
following the heuristics provided by the food experts. this is
illustrated in figure 1. in several iterations, we adjusted the
transition probabilities between the nodes to verify and impro ve
the impact of the collecti ve input values on the outcome of the
model. in this way, we achie ved consensus among the experts
based on their professional knowledge and experience.
textbox 1. the 4 advice levels in our personalized nutrition advice system.
advice levels
1. the first level provides feedback about the current food intak e—does a consumer comply with the dietary guidelines for a food group? for
example, the advice text could state “you eat little fish.”
2. the second level indicates whether the consumer’ s health status directs attention to a specif ic food category. for example, “because of your high
blood glucose level it is very important for you to consume sufficient dietary fiber.”
3. the third level motivates consumers to increase, maintain, or decrease their current dietary intak e, based on the output of the first 2 levels. for
example, “try to eat more fiber-rich products. ”
4. the fourth level provides both general and personalized practical tips. the first tip is linked to the current dietary intak e and provides the suggestion
to increase or decrease current intak e (if not meeting the guidelines) or to increase variation (if meeting the guidelines). the second tip contains
practical advice for a consumer to impro ve their health status. for example, “choose oatmeal for breakf ast, and add a full tablespoon of flaxseed
to add extra fiber.”

renderxact—comm unication for beha vior
change
overview
the final step in the process of providing personalized advice
is communicating the personalized advice to the consumer . the
way in which the advice is provided to the consumer is critical,
as studies have shown that individuals pay more attention to
recommendations that are percei ved as more relevant to them
. several approaches can be used to increase percei ved
relevance of the advice by the consumer . in our pnas and
studies, the following 4 approaches for personalized
communication were applied:
•provide feedback about consumer’ s current lifestyle and
health status to confront them with their actual behavior or
health status, motivate them to take action, and monitor
their impro vements over time
•increase the relevance and applicability of the advice itself
by ensuring that it fits a consumer’ s preferences, for
example, by adjusting the framing and format of the advice
to the personal characteristics of the recei ver
•determine an appropriate source—the source of the advice
plays an important role in determining the credibility of the
advice
•apply behavior change techniques to increase the
involvement and compliance of the consumer with the
advice, for instance, by using implementation intentions or
if-then plans specifying when, where, and how one will
achie ve a certain behavior .
these 4 approaches are further discussed in the following
sections.
feedback about health status and beha vior
in both studies in which we applied our pnas, we not only
provided personalized advice to the participants but also
feedback about their current health and dietary status. in the
study with highly motivated consumers, feedback and advice
were provided via a web-based portal and discussed during a
telephone consultation with a dietician. follow-up was
performed via email. in the study with consumers with low
socioeconomic status, the feedback and advice were provided
via a report that was sent to participants via email. as consumers
should not be overwhelmed by the feedback, long lists of data
that consumers cannot interpret or do not know how to act on
should be avoided. to make feedback about health status more
easily understandable by consumers, several strate gies can be
applied, such as color coding or composite scores that give anoverall view of the health status or benchmarking personal data
to the general population or peer groups (for an example, refer
to the study by morro w et al ).
in our pnas, we provided consumers with their individual
scores on relati vely well-kno wn single biomark er values (eg,
blood pressure, body weight, and cholesterol) and plotted them
against generally accepted health y ranges. color coding was
used to indicate whether the individual values were within the
health y range, borderline, or outside the health y range (figure
2). this strate gy has been shown to increase understanding of
health data, especially for people with low numerac y skills .
in addition, in the study with highly motivated consumers, we
provided health status feedback by integrating the outcomes of
all mark ers into a composite score for overall metabolic health
(figure 3). to calculate the metabolic health score, a so-called
health space model was developed (refer to the
sensing—p ersonalized data section). visualizations of such a
metabolic health score may provide a valuable tool in
communicating overall health status to individuals and can be
used to show how an individual scores as compared with peers
or to monitor changes in health over time [15,73]. this may
make it easy for individuals to see their progress over time, as
compared with having to weigh changes in various health
parameters themselv es.
furthermore, in the study with consumers with low
socioeconomic status, feedback about dietary intak e was
provided by means of stars per food category (eg, vegetables,
whole grains, and unhealth y snacks), which reflected a score
on a scale from 1 to 10 (multimedia appendix 1). visualizing
these scores helped to impro ve understanding in a group with
low socioeconomic status . nevertheless, although we tried
to make it simple, especially in the study with consumers with
low socioeconomic status, some individuals indicated in the
evaluation of the study that the feedback was sometimes difficult
to understand (figure 2and multimedia appendix 1). this
outcome indicates how difficult it is to provide the correct
format of feedback and how concisely these aspects have to be
adjusted to the target group. as our studies were performed
with 2 different target groups and the provided feedback and
advice formats were not identical between these studies, no firm
conclusions can be drawn on how to best differentiate in
communicating feedback between these target groups. future
studies including various target groups that are exposed to
various types of feedback and advice should be performed to
further investig ate how feedback can best be communicated to
(different types of) consumers.

relevance and applicability of personalized advice
moti vation to recei ve personalized advice and engagement in
a personalized dietary program are essential for the success of
a pnas. to increase this motivation, personalized
recommendations should connect to the most important goals
that consumers may have regarding recei ving personalized
dietary advice. the results of a consumer survey conducted
within the personalized nutrition and health program revealed
that having a clear health goal (eg, losing weight) is a more
important determinant of success than just obtaining insight
into one’s dietary pattern and obtaining possibilities for
impro vement . in addition, a difference was observ ed
between age groups—older people were relati vely more
interested in recei ving advice regarding specif ic health solutions(ie, losing weight, avoiding illness, or impro ving specif ic health
aspects), whereas young people were more holistically interested
in impro ving their lifestyle (ie, feeling fitter, gaining more
energy, or developing health y eating habits) by means of
personalized recommendations.
the applicability of the advice can be increased by the way in
which the advice is formulated. as indicated previously , in the
studies, the advice text contained practical tips (textbox 2).
evaluation of the studies indicated that the provided
personalized advice was percei ved as helpful to impro ve diet,
easy to understand, useful, and fun. more importantly , the
groups of participants that recei ved personalized advice better
saw the link between their diet scores and showed greater
impro vement in dietary habits than the group of participants
that did not recei ve personalized advice.

• you eat few whole-grain products
• because of your increased waist circumference, it is extra important for you to eat enough dietary fiber. try to eat more products rich in dietary
fiber. tips for eating more dietary fiber:
• try to choose whole meal bread more often and use whole meal products in the evening meal such as whole meal pasta, potatoes, and brown
rice.
• try to opt for legumes more often by adding lentils, chickpeas or kidne y beans in a salad or soup, or eat a slice of whole meal bread with
hummus.
sour ce of personalized advice
the source of personalized advice influences percei ved
trustw orthiness, relevance, and adherence. previous studiesshow that a dietician is percei ved as one of the most suitable
providers of personalized nutrition advice . in our study
with highly motivated consumer s with premetabolic syndr ome,
the advice was provided by a dietician, which was percei ved as
j med internet res 2023 | vol. 25 | e37667 | p. 8 https://www .jmir.org/2023/1/e37667

xsl•fo
renderxpositi ve. however, advice obtained via telephone consultation
was appreciated higher than that obtained via email. in
consultation with the dietician, the advice generated by the
model was discussed and further aligned to individual needs
and capabilities, resulting in a behavior change strate gy (eg,
adjusting portion sizes or replacement of products within or
outside the food category).
beha vior change techniques
an important way to realize behavior change is through the
application of behavior change techniques that are proven to be
effective . a behavior change technique is a strate gy that
helps an individual to change their behavior to promote better
health. michie et al developed a hierarchically ordered
taxonomy of 93 distinct behavior change techniques with labels,
definitions, and examples. for our studies, we used one of these
techniques, that is, implementation intentions, or if-then plans
specifying when, where, and how one will achie ve a certain
behavior . previous research findings show that
implementation intentions are more effective when consumers
can formulate their own implementation intentions [78-80]. in
addition, it is suggested that consumers can only handle a few
behavior changes or implementation intentions at a time [78,81].
this could make implementation intentions a perfect tool to
implement personalized advice. for example, in a pilot study
among older consumers, participants were instructed to
formulate implementation intentions in which they described
how they planned to apply at least 2 pieces of the recei ved
personalized advice . more specif ically , participants had to
explicitly indicate at which time of the day and in which
situation they were planning to replace an unhealth y product
that they reported in their 3-day food diary with a health y
product. however, as the results of this pilot study show that
compliance with the personalized advice did not impro ve
throughout the study period, replacing one food with a health y
alternati ve is likely to be insuf ficient. in our personalized advice
system, we used free text to formulate the implementation
intentions instead of using predef ined text fields. in one study ,
a dietician helped consumers with formulating these
implementation intentions, whereas in the other study ,
implementation intentions were formulated together with the
researcher in the supermark et. future studies have to determine
how the effectiveness of implementation intentions can be
further optimized and supported.
ethics approval
the study with highly motivated consumers was conducted in
accordance with the declaration of helsinki, and the protocol
was appro ved by the ethics committee of tilburg university
(file number nl61382.028.17). for the study with consumers
with low socioeconomic status, the ethics committee of tilburg
university (file number nw2017-42) determined that the study
does not fall under the medical research involving human
subjects act. all participants provided informed consent for
inclusion before they participated in the studies.discussion
summary
in this paper , we described the rationale behind the design
choices made while developing our pnas using the sense ,
reason, and actprinciple. this pnas was tested in 2 studies,
1 with highly motivated consumer s with premetabolic syndr ome
and 1 with consumer s with a low socioeconomic status . the
reasoning engine, a bbn, was identical for both studies and
could handle different combinations of input parameters. for
the study with highly motivated consumers, the resulting
feedback and advice were displayed in a web-based portal. for
the study with consumers with low socioeconomic status,
feedback and advice were provided via an automatically
generated report that was sent to the participants via email.
sensing
in terms of sensing , the main challenge is to decide which input
parameters are relevant for your pnas. the consumer burden
of performing measurements should be weighed against their
added value in providing a more personalized dietary
recommendation. the main determinants in choosing
measurement methods are their reliability , validity ,
responsi veness , and feasibility in a given setting (eg,
do-it-yourself setting). self-reporting can result in low data
quality , irrespecti ve of the method selected [83,84]. in contrast,
the gold-standard method, such as using double-labeled water
for caloric intak e , is not always feasible in a real-life setting.
the measurement method that is most suitable (eg, for
measuring food intak e) in a given setting depends on multiple
factors, such as the required level of detail (food patterns, food
groups, or specif ic nutrients), available guidance when collecting
the data, and measurement frequenc y. when using
self-reporting, it is important to design short questionnaires to
obtain information from individuals. for example,
demark-w ahnefried et al showed that interv ention
participants found brief interim surveys that assessed specif ic
behaviors more helpful than long, standardized surveys. in
addition, technology-based tools such as those using additional
food images can help to impro ve the data accurac y of
self-reported dietary assessments [87,88]. finally , one may also
consider adding supplementary sources, such as purchase data
or dietary intak e mark ers.
for health monitoring, new technologies and do-it-yourself
options are becoming available. health can be monitored via
different types of wearables and at-home assessment kits
(pregnanc y test and genetic testing). however, the accurac y and
validity of these measurement methods are not always
guaranteed, especially in a do-it-yourself setting [89,90].
collecting dried blood spots is possible in an at-home setting
but requires high-quality blood spots and may be subject to
undersampling or hematocrit bias or effect , and sufficient
analysis capacity is required. the type of measurement that is
acceptable also depends on the target group. our studies showed
that highly motivated individuals were more willing to accept
blood sampling to recei ve more detailed personal advice 
than individuals with low socioeconomic status who were not

renderxparticularly interested in nutrition-related solutions for health

the collected health data can also help to impro ve the algorithms
underlying personalized advice. for instance, they can assist in
identifying food-health relations at an individual level. the key
is that the health information can be linked to nutritional
recommendations. it can be argued that a single measurement
is not sufficient and that long-term monitoring and reassessment
are required to track changes in dietary behavior and health
effects. with this input, the advice to the individual can be
continuously updated and fine-tuned.
when providing feedback about health status, the potential for
health gain for the individual should be clear . for instance, the
wii fit regularly shows consumers the difference between their
real age and their wii fit age. in theory , this could be a
meaningful score, but in practice, it has been proven invalid
and unreliable . the new definition of health calls for
alternati ve assessment methods that observ e the body’ s systemic
response to variable circumstances instead of performing a
single measurement, such as fasting glucose level . this
could be achie ved by integrating multiple biomark ers or
phenotypic traits into a single, understandable score that
represents health . in the future, other measurements could
also be included (ie, mixed meal, exercise, or stress challenge
tests ), but their added value for personalized nutrition and
feasibility in practical conditions are still unclear .
in summary , regarding sensing , we recommend to try to find a
good balance between the input parameters that you need to
deliver the personalized dietary advice and the burden that you
pose on your user—match the necessary parameters to the
intended purpose of your pnas and make a distinction between
must have parameters and nice to have parameters. in addition,
also in terms of repeated measurements, each time you ask a
user for personal data, think about the value that you can provide
them in return.
reasoning
regarding reasoning , we discussed the use of a bbn for
representing food-health relations. this approach allows
combining a knowledge-dri ven approach with a data-dri ven
approach; at first, a qualitati ve netw ork can be created with
nutritional experts, which can then be enhanced with
observ ational data. however, the latter requires sufficiently
large data sets. therefore, in small studies, other
knowledge-based modeling approaches may be more suitable,
such as decision trees or system dynamics models . the
main challenge in such approaches is to determine the strength
and reliability of the food-health relations. ideally , we would
assign a standardized level of evidence mark er for each
knowledge rule. with such a parameter , each user of a
knowledge rule could decide which level of evidence is
acceptable in a particular use case . an advantage of
expert-dri ven models is that they are transparent and can be
based on biologically plausible mechanisms . advantages
of a data-dri ven approach are that data from many different
mark ers can be analyzed simultaneously , for instance, using
machine learning techniques . disadv antages are that the
interpretability of such models and algorithms may be low andthat these methods are at risk of sampling and selection bias
. hybrid models that combine both approaches could provide
the best of both worlds. in any case, the developed models and
pnas systems as a whole should be validated using human
interv ention studies, published in peer-reviewed journals .
to summarize, for reasoning , the main message is to carefully
consider whether a data-dri ven, knowledge-dri ven, or hybrid
model is best suited for the intended pnas. in addition, we
recommend to not build your system around a particular
technology or softw are solution. technologies become obsolete,
and it is risky to rely on a single softw are solution. instead,
think about the basic algorithm or knowledge rules that you aim
for in your system and implement them in a modular architecture
(ie, based on web services that can be maintained
independently). in addition, ensure that you have a clear
understanding of the role of the data that you build your system
around and have a clear data security plan.
acting
for acting , we discussed the importance of proper
communication of feedback and advice to consumers and the
use of behavior change techniques for activating consumers
(eg, implementation plans). note that, until now, little to no
scientif ic research has been conducted to determine how a
personalized nutrition advice should best be communicated to
consumers . this is a serious shortcoming, as studies show
that the way in which message content is processed and
remembered greatly depends on how this information is
delivered [96,97]. relevant insights from social psychology
and mark eting literature can be useful to formulate advice for
consumers that is effective in helping them to choose and
maintain an optimal personalized diet.
in developing our pnas, we also considered the format of the
feedback and advice provided. for example, to make feedback
about health status more easily understandable, color coding or
composite scores were used. at this point, composite scores
mostly represent a specif ic aspect of health, such as metabolic
health, muscle health, or inflammation status [24,98]. the
integration of all mark ers in a single health score could be even
more effective. other approaches that integrate multiple health
aspects in a single visualization are already available, but none
of these provide a single health score [73,99]. the influence of
composite health scores on consumer understanding, motivation,
and behavior change is not sufficiently known yet.
the advice we presented in the studies contained practical tips,
making the advice more easily applicable in daily life. ideally ,
the framing and format of such advice is adjusted to personal
characteristics of the receiver of the advice. in one of our studies,
this was accomplished by a dietician, who adapted the advice
to a practical application for the participant. however, ideally ,
a digital advice system also takes these personal needs into
account. this may involve tailoring the framing and timing of
the advice to specif ic personality types . previous studies
have shown that both an entirely digital approach and a digital
approach combined with coaching resulted in health y dietary
behavior; however, user engagement was higher in the combined
approach .

xsl•fo
renderxin addition, we asked participants to formulate implementation
intentions. future studies should examine other behavior change
techniques also. as an extended list of techniques exist (eg, as
specif ied by michie et al ) that could potentially add to the
effectiveness of personalized dietary advice, we recommend
future studies to incorporate a broad range of behavior change
techniques and identify potential syner gies by combining
different behavior change techniques. for example, social
cogniti ve theory provides insight into how individuals
regulate their behavior to achie ve goals that can be maintained
over time. for example, self-ef ficacy, defined as the extent to
which one belie ves in their own ability to reach a certain goal,
has an effect on actually reaching that goal . however,
self-ef ficacy is difficult to influence, also when using
personalized advice, as shown by doets et al . they found
that self-ef ficacy decreased during the study in both the
interv ention group that recei ved personalized nutrition advice
and the control group that recei ved generic dietary advice. this
reduced self-ef ficacy could also be a result of the fact that during
the study , participants were confronted with their (unhealth y)
diet, which may lead to lack of confidence in someone’ s ability
to succeed . in their meta-analysis, prestwich et al 
revealed that emotional stress could undermine a positi ve effect
on self-ef ficacy. interv entions that incorporate techniques that
help to manage this stress were more successful in raisingdietary self-ef ficacy than interv entions that do not. therefore,
we recommend future studies in the conte xt of personalized
nutrition advice to also include some type of stress management
technique as part of the interv ention.
to summarize, regarding acting , it is important to tailor the
communication of the advice to the target group, in terms of
format, choice of words, and comple xity. moreo ver, use
different behavior change techniques and choose the technique
that best meets the needs of the target group.
conclusions
to set up or further develop a personalized advice system
considering a sense, reason, and act approach is of value. it
provides guidance and structure for making design choices for
developing a (partly) digitalized solution. besides the type of
personal dietary advice and the mode through which it is
generated, the communication of the advice and appropriate
behavior change techniques should be considered, as this will
determine the level of consumer adherence. this paper shows
the vastness of choice options in designing personalized advice

undernutrition remains a global struggle and is associated with almost 45% of 
deaths in children younger than 5years. despite advances in management of 
severe wasting (though less so for nutritional edema), full and sustained recovery 
remains elusive. children with severe wasting and/or nutritional edema (also com -
monly referred to as severe acute malnutrition and part of the umbrella term 
“severe malnutrition” ) continue to have a high mortality rate. this suggests a likely 
multifactorial etiology that may include micronutrient deficiency. micronutrients 
are currently provided in therapeutic foods at levels based on expert opinion, with 
few supportive studies of high quality having been conducted. this narrative review 
looks at the knowledge base on micronutrient deficiencies in children aged 
6–59 months who have severe wasting and/or nutritional edema, in addition to 
highlighting areas where further research is warranted (see “future directions” 
section).

nutrition and regulation of muscle protein synthesis

skeletal muscles are an indispensable actor for daily activities, playing an essential role
in locomotion through both the control of posture and position and by joint stabilization.
in addition, they are involved in body temperature maintenance and constitute nutrient
reserves. skeletal muscle represents approximately 40% of human body weight, but this
percentage physiologically decreases when tissue undergoes atrophy. during aging, a
decline in muscle strength and mass can be observed and muscle mass decreases by ap-
proximately 3–8% per decade after 30 years of age and this reduction appears significant
after 60 years [ 1]. muscle mass loss with age is associated with a variety of clinical fea-
tures which include alterations in body glucose homeostasis, falls, fractures, disability, and
chronic diseases. moreover, skeletal muscle dysfunctions or genetic abnormalities, such
as myopathies, dysphagia, ataxia, weakness, tremors, and tendon ruptures, can lead to
muscle mass reduction. skeletal muscle mass depends on a fine balance between protein
synthesis and protein degradation, and several signals, including oxidative, mechanical,
and nutritional stimuli, as well as cytokines or growth factor, are involved in the modu-
lation of the signaling pathways that control protein and organelle turnover [ 2]. cancer,
infections, diabetes, organ failure, or disuse promote the loss of proteins, organelles, and
cytoplasm, leading to muscle atrophy. therefore, the maintenance of the correct biogenesis
and biosynthesis appears necessary in defining the size and function of muscle cells [ 2].
in this scenario, nutrition intake represents a potential clinical intervention since it can
reactivate protein synthesis during atrophy. in this regard, some epidemiological studies
have indicated strategic diets with a sufficient intake of beneficial foods for preventing
sarcopenia, a condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle mass and function
with advancing age [ 3]. sarcopenia comprises some common muscle features including a
decrease in muscle mass, a reduction in the size and in the number of myofibers, as well
as in in the number and function of satellite cells. the latter, known as resident muscle
stem cells, play a crucial role in muscle regeneration and in maintaining muscle mass
during aging. satellite cells are localized at the periphery of the muscle fiber, between
the basal lamina and sarcolemma; they are quiescent under normal conditions, and they
are activated after muscle damage [ 4]. several studies associated a low level of vitamin
b6 with sarcopenia and, in particular, an original paper published in this special issue
demonstrated that vitamin b6 deficiency induces satellite cell dysfunctions [ 5]. vitamin
b6 is involved in amino acid metabolism, and it can be considered a potential antioxidant
for cells. komura et al. (2023) [ 5] showed that a low vitamin b6 uptake led to an impaired
satellite cell synthesis or reduced satellite cell proliferation capacity in skeletal muscle mice,
thus contributing to sarcopenic phenotype development.
with regard to sarcopenia, shin et al. (2023) [ 6] discussed the role of panax ginseng
berry extract (gbe) in sarcopenic obese mice. sarcopenic obesity, the combined state
of sarcopenia and obesity, leads to higher risks of metabolic diseases and disability and
therapeutic strategies to tackle this disease are still lacking. the authors demonstrated
that gbe, obtained from the root of panax ginseng, a known medical herb with anticancer,
antidiabetic, anti-obesity, and anti-inflammatory properties, could improve this pathologic
condition. in fact, gbe acted by restoring the correct balance between protein synthesis and
nutrients 2023 ,15, 4017. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15184017 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrientsnutrients 2023 ,15, 4017 2 of 3
degradation through promoting the activation of the pi3k/akt pathway in skeletal muscle
mice. as is known, the upregulation of pi3k and akt leads to a significant increase in the
phosphorylation of all mammalian targets correlated to protein synthesis. therefore, gbe
administration in sarcopenic obese mice significantly increased muscle mass, increased the
myofiber cross-sectional area, and decreased adipose tissue weights and adipocyte size, as
well as increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines in the muscle tissue .
in their paper, jeun and choung (2023) [ 7] described the potential role of oyster hy-
drolysates in preventing muscle atrophy. oyster hydrolysates, marine food resources
containing high-quality proteins, show antioxidant, anti-inflammation, and anti-cancer
activities. thanks to these properties, jeun and choung demonstrated the ability of these
compounds to prevent the c2c12 myotube diameter reduction induced by dexametha-
sone treatment. oyster hydrolysates stimulated protein turnover, particularly pi3k/akt
pathway activation, and mitochondrial biogenesis .
another high-quality protein that contributes to the maintenance of skeletal muscle
mass is egg white protein (egg), an arginine-rich protein source with a lower amount of
leucine. koshinaka et al. (2023) demonstrated that egg supplementation in rats had a
higher efficiency in muscle gain compared to other common animal-based proteins .
continuing the discussion of dietary protein as an important strategy to manage and
prevent sarcopenia, lees et al. (2023) [ 9], in their original paper, considered fish protein
hydrolysates (fph) as high-quality sources of dietary protein. the authors demonstrated
the ability of fph to promote skeletal muscle synthesis activation in the skeletal muscle
cell model, suggesting that fsh could be considered an alternative source of readily
bioavailable protein to support skeletal muscle health and anabolism in older people .
this special issue also includes a paper evaluating rosemary leaf extract activity in
primary skeletal muscle cells [ 10]. rosemary leaf extract is a source of phenolic compounds
and shows interesting biological properties, including antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory,
antioxidant, and anticancer benefits. its antioxidant activities are mainly attributed to a
phenolic diterpene known as carnosol. morel and coworkers (2023) [ 10] demonstrated
carnosol’s ability to activate the signaling pathways involved in the control of skeletal
muscle hypertrophy and atrophy. carnosol inhibited both proteosome and protein degra-
dation activity and, in this way, it appears useful for the treatment or prevention of skeletal
muscle atrophy.
among the original articles published in this special issue, salucci et al. (2023) [ 11]
described the effect of curcumin on rhabdomyosarcoma, a malignant tumor of striated
muscle. it originates from mesenchymal precursors that, under normal conditions, dif-
ferentiate into skeletal muscle cells, but in presence of aberrations they fail to complete
myogenesis [ 12,13]. curcumin, thanks to its anticancer properties, leads to cell cycle arrest,
inhibits cell migration, and induces apoptotic cell death involving the akt-mammalian
targets of rapamycin (mtor), amp-dependent kinase (ampk), and p53 .
finally, this special issue contains two reviews that recognize nutritional interventions
as an important strategy to manage and prevent skeletal muscle loss. in this regard,
massini and colleagues (2023) [ 14] discussed the nutritional and dietary strategies useful
in preventing or delaying the loss of muscle mass, a complication that can frequently
be observed in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd). in the review, the authors
suggested that low-protein diets supplemented with essential amino acids and ketoacids
could have beneficial effects in preserving muscle mass and slowing the progression of
ckd [ 13]. furthermore, salucci and coworkers (2023) [ 15] underlined the role of extra
virgin olive oil (evoo) in maintaining skeletal muscle homeostasis during aging. the data
collected suggest that evoo, thanks to its phenolic content, can activate anabolic pathways
and counteract mitochondrial alterations and inflammatory processes.
in conclusion, this special issue in nutrients , titled “nutrition and regulation of

abstract: personalized nutrition is an approach that tailors nutrition advice to individuals based on
an individual’s genetic information. despite interest among scholars, the impact of this approach
on lifestyle habits and health has not been adequately explored. hence, a systematic review of
randomized trials reporting on the effects of personalized nutrition on dietary, physical activity, and
health outcomes was conducted. a systematic search of seven electronic databases and a manual
search resulted in identifying nine relevant trials. cochrane’s risk of bias was used to determine the
trials’ methodological quality. although the trials were of moderate to high quality, the findings did
not show consistent benefits of personalized nutrition in improving dietary, behavioral, or health
outcomes. there was also a lack of evidence from regions other than north america and europe
or among individuals with diseases, affecting the generalizability of the results. furthermore, the
complex relationship between genes, interventions, and outcomes may also have contributed to
the scarcity of positive findings. we have suggested several areas for improvement for future trials
regarding personalized nutrition.

1. introduction
unhealthy diets have long been established as contributors to the escalating prevalence
of non-communicable diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
cancers in a population. these diseases are often major contributing factors to mortality
and morbidity [ 1–3]. thus, current population and individual-based approaches aim to
prevent and manage risks in populations or individuals with the underlying understand-
ing that modifiable lifestyle-related factors, including diet and nutrient intakes, have a
significant role in the etiology and progression of diseases [ 3]. these approaches are gov-
erned by the assumption that a universal dietary recommendation would work similarly
in all individuals and, therefore, in a population. however, this approach is thought to
conveniently ignore the inter-individual variations in dietary response that are increasingly
being reported .
nutrients 2022 ,14, 4104. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14194104 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrientsnutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 2 of 13
consequently, it is unsurprising that despite knowledge and research into the link
between disease and diet, most dietary interventions and alterations achieve a relatively
modest and limited effect on health outcomes, demonstrating the challenges of universal
approaches [ 2,5,6]. with the advent of technological advances in data capture and analysis,
there is an increasing awareness that one size may not fit all. increasing interest in preci-
sion and personalized medicine are paralleled by exploration in personalizing nutrition
recommendations for individuals.
personalized nutrition targets prevent diseases and maintain good health using nu-
tritional recommendations tailored to an individual [ 7–10]. it is derived from the concept
that inter-individual differences exist in response to nutrition and dietary patterns. these
differences are attributed to individual variations in biochemistry, metabolism, genetics,
and microbiota [ 7]. owing to the underlying similarity and overlaps in applying the above
concept, the terms personalized nutrition, precision nutrition, nutrigenetics, nutrigenomics,
and stratified nutrition are often used interchangeably. however, nuanced differences exist
in their approaches [ 11]. precision nutrition provides personalized nutritional recommen-
dations based on interacting factors in a person’s internal and external environment. it
is based on genetics, epigenetics, food habits, microbiota, metabolome, physical activity,
lifestyle factors, and their interactions [ 12]. the recommendations oftentimes account for
the interactions between nutrients and biological processes in an individual, resulting in
differential responses to food-derived nutrients .
personalized nutrition is purported to be more beneficial than more generalized ap-
proaches based on two main concepts. first, genotypic and phenotypic characteristics differ
among individuals and cause differential responses to food and nutrients. this implies
that there theoretically exists a specific diet that is most beneficial for a specific individual.
the second idea is that an appropriate intervention recommended after analyzing one’s
current behavior, preferences, and objectives will motivate and better enable individuals to
make decisions and changes to their eating patterns [ 8]. this, in turn, would mean better
compliance with the recommendations. therefore, hypothetically, personalization in such
interventions may be more beneficial in achieving health goals [ 2]. while personalized
nutrition remains a topic of interest among scholars, its adoption into current practice is
limited. for widespread adoption of personalized nutrition, there is a need to collate and
review current evidence on the impact of personalized nutrition on health outcomes.
acknowledging this paucity of evidence on the benefit of personalized nutrition, we
conduct a systematic review of published randomized trials on the effect of personalized
nutrition on dietary intake, physical activity, and various health outcomes. the extracted
data is synthesized qualitatively, noting specific trends in populations, age groups, and
settings where personalized nutrition interventions have been compared with conventional
nutrition interventions using randomized-controlled trials (rcts). this review collates
details on intervention delivery characteristics, including the intervention provider, in-
tervention duration, and delivery settings, and identifies their potential impact, if any,
on intervention outcomes. this review also aims to identify health outcomes that show
improvement with personalized nutrition and those that show no additional benefit. fi-
nally, this systematic review will assess the quality of the available evidence and identify
gaps in the literature on the effectiveness of personalized nutrition and identify areas for
improvement in future trials in this area.
2. materials and methods
2.1. study design
we used the updated preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-
analyses (prisma) 2020 statement [ 13] and checklist (supplementary table s1) to guide
this systematic review. the review protocol has been registered with the international
prospective register of systematic reviews (prospero) (crd42021282746) and is publicly
available via https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?recordid=282746
[accessed on 25 october 2021].nutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 3 of 13
2.2. search strategy
we systematically searched the literature in seven electronic bibliographic databases
(ovid medline, pubmed, cinahl plus, scopus, embase, cochrane central register of
controlled trials, and sciencedirect). the following keywords and boolean operators
were used to build the search strategy (“personali?ed nutrition” or “individuali?ed nutri-
tion” or “precision nutrition”) and (genomic* or gene* or genetic* or phenotype or
genotype or dna).
the search was conducted from a journal’s inception to august 2021 and limited
to “human studies” and “randomized-controlled trials” where possible. we imposed no
language restrictions. a complete database search strategy is shown in supplementary
table s2.
2.3. study selection
the study selection process was managed using the covidence platform [ 14]. records
obtained from database searches were uploaded to covidence, and duplicated records were
automatically removed. the title and abstracts were first screened according to eligibility
criteria. this was followed by the screening of full texts. two authors (k.x.l. and s.h.)
conducted both screening processes independently, and any arising conflicts were resolved
by a third author (a.r.).
we included all randomized trials that reported the effect of personalized nutrition-
based dietary intervention on any nutrition or health outcome. this includes individualized
nutrition intervention based on an individual’s genetic information gathered at baseline.
there were no restrictions with regard to the demography and phenotype of the participants,
length of intervention, or geographical location. however, we excluded studies that only
gathered genetic information post-intervention. studies that did not report dietary, physical
activity, or health outcomes were also excluded. grey literature and non-peer-reviewed
publications such as book chapters, online abstracts, and conference proceedings were also
excluded.
five authors (s.a.l., s.h., t.a.k., s.s., and a.s.w.t.) hand-searched the reference lists
of the included studies and past reviews to seek articles not identified in the database
searches.
2.4. quality assessment
a quality assessment in the form of a risk of bias analysis on the finalized articles was
carried out using the risk of bias assessment tool provided by the cochrane collabora-
tion [ 15]. the tool includes information on (i) selection bias (random sequence generation
and allocation concealment), (ii) performance bias, (iii) detection bias, (iv) attrition bias,
(v) reporting bias, and (vi) other bias.
2.5. data extraction and synthesis
data from eligible papers were extracted using google sheets. we extracted the study
origin, age of participants, sample size, intervention characteristics, outcomes assessed,
and, most importantly, findings from the final eligible papers. the data were independently
reviewed and verified by two authors (k.x.l. and a.r.).
no meta-analysis was performed due to the heterogeneous nature of the studies and
data. however, the extracted data were qualitatively synthesized, noting specific trends
in population, age groups, and settings where personalized nutrition intervention was
compared with conventional intervention. we also attempted to identify health outcomes
that showed improvement with personalized nutrition and challenges in implementing
personalized nutrition-based interventions.nutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 4 of 13

3.1. study selection and characteristics
a total of 1002 records were retrieved from database searches. after the removal of
duplicates, 877 titles and abstracts were screened. subsequently, 42 full texts were sought,
and 17 articles (5 unique studies) were finalized after screening according to the review’s
eligibility criteria. we found an additional four studies via manual searching. figure 1

asummary genetic risk score calculated from 36 successfully genotyped risk alleles previously associated with
type 2 diabetes;ba set of snps in genes important for obesity, eating behaviors, and exercise;cgene tests included
5 evidence-based components (diet management, weight response, food tolerances, food taste and preference,
and vitamins, minerals, and essential fats).
3.3. intervention characteristics
the majority of the interventions were carried out virtually (n = 5) [ 17,18,20–31],
followed by two interventions in primary care [ 16,31]. the remaining two interventions
were carried out in a weight management clinic [ 19] and a university campus [ 29]. the
duration of the intervention widely ranged from 8 weeks to 12 months. a dietitian or
nutritionist delivered the intervention in most trials [16,17,20–31].
in general, the intervention participants were provided with a genetic test at baseline
and subsequently received personalized advice or knowledge relevant to their genetic test
results. for example, in a trial focusing on diabetes-related behaviors [ 16], participants were
provided with a diabetes genetic report consisting of each successfully tested snp and an
overall diabetes genetic risk category. subsequently, one-on-one genetic counseling sessions
were held to explain the genetic test results and contributions of genetic and lifestyle factors
to the development of diabetes and to compare the participant’s genetic risk results with
their overall diabetes risk. on the other hand, some studies provided feedback to the
participants based on pre-determined criteria. the food4me trial [ 20–28], in particular,
provided feedback based on an algorithm that incorporated genotypic, phenotypic, diet,
lifestyle, and anthropometry information. given the multinational and multicenter nature
of the trial, food4me utilized an automated online system to achieve this [ 33]. a more
recent trial by doets and colleagues also took a multiple feedback approach based on
a set of nine personalized information categories focusing on diet and physical activity.nutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 6 of 13
interestingly, these researchers used a decision tree based on cut-off values of biological
and genetic personalization factors .
the intervention can be generally grouped into dietary and lifestyle, disease preven-
tion, and body weight. grant and colleagues [ 16] reported the only trial intervening in
high-risk participants’ diabetes and body weight through dietary and physical activity
changes and genetic counseling. personalized lifestyle advice was provided to the older
adult participants of doet et al.’s study [ 31] based on nine underlying decision trees incorpo-
rating biological and genetic personalization factors. in another study, a nutrigenic-guided
diet was advised for obese veterans to reduce body weight [ 19]. the finnish trial among
healthy adults focused on lifestyle changes based on the apoe gene .
the intervention groups are categorized into three groups in the large food4me
rct [ 20–28]. the first group was given personalized advice based on current weight,
diet, and physical activity. in contrast, the second and third groups were provided with
phenotype and genotype information, in addition to the personalized advice.
the remaining trials provided dietary advice specific to a single or group of nutri-
ents [ 18,30,31]. a canadian trial among healthy adults targeted five dietary components,
total fat, saturated fat, sugar, omega-3 fatty acids, and sodium [ 30]. another trial conducted
among healthy canadian adults provided the participants with personalized genotype-
based dietary changes based on caffeine, vitamin c, sugar, and sodium intakes [ 18]. roke
et al. [ 29] provide knowledge regarding omega-3 fatty acids and the influence of genetic
variation in fads 1 for the participants in the intervention group.
3.4. genotype assessed
genotype assessment was performed at baseline as the basis for the subsequent indi-
vidualization of nutrition intervention, with different collection kits utilized and varying
combinations of genotypes assessed.
thirteen trials assessed lipid-related genotypes, including fads1 (endogenous con-
version of ala into epa and dha) and nos3 (risk of elevated triglyceride levels re-
lated to omega-3 fat intake), and genotypes associated with lipid metabolism or choles-
terol absorption such as tcf7l2 ,apoe ,apoa2 , ppar
2, and lipc [18–22,25–32]. geno-
types related to cardiovascular health were assessed in 10 trials which include mthfr
(folate usage), ace (blood pressure response to sodium intake), and cyp1a2 (caffeine
metabolism) [18,21,22,24–28,30,31]. obesity and metabolism-related genotypes were also
assessed by 10 studies, including fto, ucp1, mc4r , and adipoq [19,21–23,25–28,31,32].
three trials assessed vitamin-related genotypes, namely gstt1 and gsm1 (vitamin c
utilization), vdr taq1 (vitamin d), and mmab (vitamin b12 metabolism) [ 18,19,31]. two
studies incorporated genotypes associated with sweet taste perception, tas1r2 andkctd10,
respectively [ 18,19]. one study assessed 36 diabetes-related snps, which were not speci-
fied [ 16].gdf5 , a genotype associated with endurance and resistance training, was assessed
in one of the studies .
3.5. dietary outcomes
3.5.1. diet quality
four studies reported the impact of personalized intervention on diet
quality [ 21,22,25,27,30]. almeida et al. [ 30] reported significant differences between groups
over time for healthy eating index-canadian (hei-c) scores, showing more significant
improvement in the intervention group who received a personalized nutrition plan that
integrated information about their gene test results, health information, personal goals, and
dietary intakes.
however, findings from the food4me trial concerning diet quality were largely in-
consistent. livingstone et al. [ 21] showed meddiet scores at six months to be greater
in individuals who received personalized intervention based on diet, phenotype, and
genotype compared with advice based on diet and phenotype alone. later in 2020, an
improvement in hei score in intervention participants who were carriers of the mthfr risknutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 7 of 13
allele was also observed [ 27]. on the contrary, two articles noted that including phenotypic
and genotypic information does not significantly change hei in participants receiving
personalized nutrition advice [22,25].
3.5.2. dietary fat
horne and colleagues [ 32] found that only the intervention group showed a significant
reduction in total dietary fat intake and saturated fatty acid intake at 12 months, while
the control group did not significantly change their dietary fat intake long-term. the
intervention group had significantly greater adherence to the group-based target for total
fat and to targets of <25% kcal from total fat and <10% kcal from saturated fat. similarly,
another canadian study [ 30] also observed group differences in the percentage of calories
from total fat and saturated fat.
the food4me trial reported no significant differences in dietary saturated fatty acids
between apoe risk and non-risk group [ 20]. however, reductions in the percentage of total
fat and saturated fatty acids were observed for those receiving advice based on genotypic
data .
hietaranta-luoma and colleagues [ 17] reported improvement in dietary fat quality by
increasing their intake of unsaturated following advice based on the apoe gene as a risk
information marker. however, this effect faded after 10 weeks of intervention. roke et al.’s
trial of young adults [ 29] found that providing participants with fas1 genetic information
did not differentiate dietary intake of epa and dha between the intervention and control
groups. however, knowing their fas1 status changed perceptions and behaviors related to
omega-3 fatty acids.
3.5.3. dietary sugar and salt
no significant impact on sugar consumption was observed in the reviewed
trials [ 18,24]. specifically, it was interesting to note that neilsen and el-sohemy [ 18],
who intervened with participants with the tas1r2 allele associated with increased risk of
over-consuming sugars, did not successfully reduce added sugar intake in the intervention
compared to controls.
in contrast, three trials found a significant reduction in salt intake following tailored
dietary advice [ 18,28,30]. a significant reduction in sodium intake was observed in the
intervention group who possessed a risk version of the ace gene and were advised
to limit their sodium intake, with an increase in the proportion who met the targeted
recommendation of 1500 mg/day from 19% at baseline to 34% after 12 months, as opposed
to the control group which showed no significant changes [ 18]. almeida and colleagues [ 30]
reported significant differences between groups over time for sodium among those who
possessed the risk genotype and received tailored dietary advice. results from the food4me
trial also found a reduction in salt intake at month 6 for those randomized to receive
personalized nutrition advice based on genotype .
3.5.4. other nutritional impacts
there is no significant improvement in the folate intake of folate-rich foods in the
food4me trial [ 24] from baseline to the sixth month of intervention among those with the
mthfr allele. nielson and el-sohemy [ 18] reported no significant changes in vitamin c
intake. however, this is likely due to the baseline intake of vitamin c already achieving
the recommended intake. the study also did not find any changes in caffeine intake in
participants with the cyp1a2 risk allele associated with an increased risk of myocardial
infarction and hypertension when consuming above 200 mg of caffeine/day .
there was no significant improvement in carotenoids among participants from ger-
many or apoe(rs7412) genotype carriers in the food4me trial [ 27]. in addition, the trial
reported significant improvement in the omega-3 index in participants who successfully
changed their physical activity level, reported moderate to vigorous physical activity
(mvpa), and have the apoe(rs429358) genotype.nutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 8 of 13
3.6. physical activity outcomes
the finnish study on personalized nutrition based on the apoe genotype reported
no significant improvement in leisure-time physical activity between the "4+,"4 , and
control groups [ 17]. assessment of diet quality using different indicators (meddiet and
hei scores) in the food4me trial resulted in the conflicting impact of the intervention on
physical activity. significant differences in moderate and vigorous physical activity among
participants with high meddiet scores compared to participants with low meddiet scores
but not the time spent in sedentary behavior and physical activity level were observed [ 21].
in contrast, the findings were not replicated in clustering based on hei scores [ 27]. in
addition, marsaux et al. [ 23] showed no significant difference in physical activity in people
having or not having the fto risk allele, a gene associated with fat mass and obesity, and
provided personalized recommendations.
3.7. health outcomes
3.7.1. weight loss and anthropometry
the effect of personalized nutrition advice on anthropometry measures varied, and
only two studies focused on weight loss or body weight changes [ 19,21,22,25–27]. no
significant impact on weight-loss parameters was observed in trials conducted among
overweight and obese individuals, which delivered personalized intervention based on a
selected set of snps related to type 2 diabetes [ 16] or genes related to components of diet
management [ 19]. doet and colleagues [ 31] reported a significant reduction in waist and
hip circumferences and body fat percentage but not bmi in older adults.
the food4me trial also reported no significant differences between groups with
personalized nutrition or control and between fto gene risk carriers and non-risk carriers
of the fto gene, respectively, in terms of body weight, bmi, and waist circumference [ 25,26].
clustering participants according to dietary intakes resulted in conflicting evidence
from the food4me trial. according to livingstone et al. [ 21], there is a significant but
small reduction in waist circumference for participants with high meddiet scores. at the
same time, there are no significant changes in body weight and bmi among both groups
with high and low meddiet scores. the food4me trial [ 22] also reported a better result in
participants who met the requirement for oily fish, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and
red meat than those who did not meet the requirement or met only partial requirements.
these participants had a healthier diet, lower bmi and waist circumference, and were
smoking less. further assessment of the impact of the food4me intervention trial among
participants with and without improvement in hei showed no significant differences in
body weight, bmi, and waist circumference .
3.7.2. blood lipids
frankwich et al. [ 19] observed no significant difference in the lipid profile (ldl, hdl-
cholesterols, and triglycerides) among participants who received genotype-based therapy
and standard therapy. the food4me trial also did not support significant changes in total
cholesterol post-personalized intervention [20,25,27].
3.7.3. quality of life
almeida et al. (2019) [ 30] reported no significant difference in health-related quality of
life between the intervention group receiving clustered gene test-based nutrition education
and the group providing an integrated practitioner-facilitated method.
3.8. quality assessment
most of the trials were of good quality (figure 2), though all studies had a high risk for
performance bias. this is primarily due to the nature of the intervention, which requires
dietary changes. in most studies, participants and personnel could not be blinded to the
dietary intervention. approximately 25% of the trials were at high risk of attrition biasnutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 9 of 13
as the intention-to-treat analysis was mostly absent, and several studies did not provide
sample size justification.

bias as the intention-to-treat analysis was mostly absent, and several studies did not pro-
vide sample size justification.

4. discussion
given the accruing evidence on inter-individual variations in dietary response [ 34–36], there
is increased interest in the additional potential benefit of using personalized approaches
to nutrition management. thus, we systematically reviewed the effect of personalized
nutrition on various health outcomes as documented in randomized controlled trials.
most interventions were delivered by healthcare professionals, primarily dietitians, or
nutritionists. only one of the included studies in this review involved a certified genetic
counselor as an intervention provider [ 16]. five of these interventions [ 17,18,20–28,30,31]
were delivered online, whereas the other interventions were delivered face to face in
primary care [ 16,32], weight loss clinics [ 19], or institutional [ 29] settings. most of the
studies were funded by national funding agencies, with only two of these studies reporting
funding in part from the industry [19,32].
among the findings, the behavioral effect of personalized nutrition in improving
several aspects of dietary intake or physical activity behaviors were either inconsistent or
statistically insignificant. the food4me trial showed that personalized nutrition recom-
mendations improved the omega -3 index in those who performed moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity but not in those who were sedentary [ 27]. the potential biological mecha-
nisms that could explain these discrepancies are not apparent. on the contrary, all three
trials that evaluated the effect of personalized nutrition interventions in reducing salt intake
showed benefits over the control intervention [ 18,28,30]. thus, the most consistent evidence
for personalized nutrition in terms of improving dietary intake exists for reducing salt
intake and potentially in terms of improving dietary fat quality.
the results of the evaluated personalized nutrition interventions on health param-
eters, including weight loss, bmi, and waist circumference, were inconsistent. studies
also showed no beneficial effect of personalized nutrition intervention on blood lipids ornutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 10 of 13
measures indicating the quality of life. the only beneficial health effect of personalized
nutrition was observed in the sole trial [ 31] that studied the benefit of a personalized
nutrition approach in reducing body fat in older adults.
no apparent association of intervention characteristics (the type of intervention de-
livery (online or face to face), the duration of the intervention, or the study sponsor) with
intervention outcome was observed. these findings are not surprising given that health out-
comes are not determined merely by gene–diet interactions. it is increasingly understood
that what and how much one eats (diet/nutrients), how one eats the diet (dietary pattern,
meal combinations, and sequence), when one eats (meal timing, timing restrictions), and
other host factors (including gut microbial profile, health or disease condition, age, gender,
behavioral and lifestyle factors) are all important in deciding the outcome of a diet for an in-
dividual [ 36–39]. the results of the current review evaluated specific personalized nutrition
recommendations against a control that reflected current standard practice in delivering
interventions. hence, the findings are insufficient to conclude the additional benefits of
personalized nutrition interventions and their long-term health impact in comparison to
existing standard dietary recommendation practices.
the overall quality of the studies included in this review was moderate to high, with
the common limitation being the inability to blind participants and researchers to the
intervention allocation. this is a general limitation in nutrition trials and is not specific
to those in personalized nutrition. nevertheless, the findings from this review need to be
interpreted cautiously due to several observations. first, the standard of reporting currently
among literature reporting on personalized nutrition needs much improvement. there is
also the need to better document and report personalized nutrition interventions. most
of the excluded studies in this review did not sufficiently describe dietary intervention.
there was an omission of documentation on who delivered the intervention [ 31]. process
fidelity was also poorly captured among all included trials. without sufficient description,
interventions cannot be reliably implemented, replicated, or built upon [ 40]. adopting
the template for intervention description and replication (tidier) suggested by the equa-
tor network will enable better reporting of interventions in terms of their completeness,
specifically for non-drug-related interventions such as personalized nutrition management.
second, it should be noted that most of the studies were conducted in north america
and europe and had small to moderate sample sizes. while there was a good spread of
evidence across categories of the adult life span, intervention in children and adolescents
is lacking. additionally, most of the participants included in these studies were healthy
adults. therefore, further evidence is required to determine the usefulness of personalized
nutrition approaches in the treatment or management of diet-related non-communicable
diseases. thus, the generalization of these findings must be carried out with caution.
third, the genotypes assessed include gene–diet interactions related to lipid metabolism
(fads1 ,nos3 ,tcf7l2 ,apoe ,apoa2 , ppar
2,lipc ), vitamin metabolism ( gstt1 ,gsm1 ,
vdr taq1 ,mmab ,mthfr ), and caffeine metabolism ( cyp1a2 ). evaluated genotypes also
included those relating to cardiovascular health ( ace ), obesity and metabolism-related
genotypes ( fto, ucp1, mc4r, andadipoq ), sweet taste perception (tas1r2 and kctd10 ),
and endurance ( gdf5 ). one study focused on clustered gene testing related to diet manage-
ment, weight response, food tolerances, food taste and preferences, and vitamins, minerals,
and essential fats [ 30]. thus, while the results from these studies are of academic interest,
the long-term effects of the personalized nutrition interventions based on narrow genotyp-
ing defined by research interest remain poorly understood, given that interactions between
various genotypes have not been characterized.
it is argued that personalized nutrition approaches could be more successful as they
are tailored to an individual. it is also likely that compliance with such interventions is
higher and facilitates long-term maintenance of positive behavioral changes [ 2,11]. inter-
estingly, one-third of the trials included in this study had an increased risk of attrition
bias, bringing into question the improved compliance expected with the existing per-
sonalized nutrition approaches. additionally, the longest duration documented in thenutrients 2022 ,14, 4104 11 of 13
studies included in this review was one year, with many studies ranging between three
and four months. statistically, significant improvements occur after the first six months of
the nutritional intervention [ 41], but the effects of long-term nutritional studies are more
modest. this is because maintaining long-term behaviors in the current food environment
is challenging [ 41]. thus, while most behavioral interventions of medium duration to
improve diet and physical activity are reportedly successful, there is a paucity of evidence
for longer-term efficacy, which would determine the significance of its impact [41,42].
given the above concerns, there is a need for robust, well-described personalized
nutrition interventions with a well-justified selection of genotyping and spelt-out objectives,
specifically in children and adolescents. most importantly, there is a need to measure diets
accurately in such trials [ 43]. without accurately measuring what was consumed before the
intervention and having a sensitive measurement of the dietary and nutrient changes that
happen over time, it is impossible to attribute causality in any nutrition trial, including those
in personalized nutrition. hence, investment in the development of dietary assessment
tools and food composition databases is of utmost importance prior to studying the effects
of dietary recommendations. the duration of the intervention should also be justified
considering the expected endpoints or outcomes, the timeframe of their expected changes,
and the sustainability of a benefit, if any. an essential challenge to conducting further
investigation is also the sample size required to appropriately power trials to evaluate the
benefits of personalized nutrition over conventionally delivered interventions in lieu of
the complexity and heterogeneity of host factors and the large measurement errors while
measuring dietary exposure, the multiple possibilities of diet–gene interactions, and other
confounders [ 43]. furthermore, the cost to impact evaluation of personalized nutrition
versus conventional approaches requires further investigation to evaluate the justification
of adoption into practice for individualized and population-based approaches.
5. conclusions
in this review, we systematically collated the available evidence from randomized
controlled trials on personalized nutrition and its impact on health outcomes. overall,
current evidence did not show consistent benefits of personalized nutrition in improving
behavioral or health outcomes over the current standard practice. evidence also does
not suggest improved compliance or quality of life resulting from personalized nutrition
interventions. with heterogeneity in the gene–diet interactions evaluated, and interven-
tions tested and the lack of a theoretical framework supporting the development of these
interventions, the generalizability of the existing evidence, at this time, remains poor.

abstract
position statement: the international society of sports nutrition (issn) provides an objective and critical review
related to the intake of protein for healthy, exercising individuals. based on the current available literature, the
position of the society is as follows:
1) an acute exercise stimulus, particularly resistance exercise, and protein ingestion both stimulate muscle protein
synthesis (mps) and are synergistic when protein consumption occurs before or after resistance exercise.
2) for building muscle mass and for maintaining muscle mass through a positive muscle protein balance, an
overall daily protein intake in the range of 1.4 –2.0 g protein/kg body weight/day (g/kg/d) is sufficient for
most exercising individuals, a value that falls in line within the acceptable macronutrient distribution range
published by the institute of medicine for protein.
3) there is novel evidence that suggests higher protein intakes (>3.0 g/kg/d) may have positive effects on body
composition in resistance-trained individuals (i.e., promote loss of fat mass).
4) recommendations regarding the optimal protein intake per serving for athletes to maximize mps are mixed
and are dependent upon age and recent resistance exercise stimuli. general recommendations are 0.25 g of a
high-quality protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute dose of 20 –40 g.
5) acute protein doses should strive to contain 700 –3000 mg of leucine and/or a higher relative leucine content,
in addition to a balanced array of the essential amino acids (eaas).
6) these protein doses should ideally be evenly distributed, every 3 –4 h, across the day.
7) the optimal time period during which to ingest protein is likely a matter of individual tolerance, since benefits
are derived from pre- or post-workout ingestion; however, the anabolic effect of exercise is long-lasting
(at least 24 h), but likely diminishes with increasing time post-exercise.

in 2007, the international society of sports nutrition
(issn) published its first position stand devoted to the
science and application of dietary protein intake .
subsequently, this paper has been accessed more than
200,000 times and continues to serve as a key reference
on the topic. in the past ten years, there have been contin-
ued efforts to advance the science and application of diet-
ary protein intake for the benefit of athletes and fitness-
minded individuals. this updated position stand includes
new information and addresses the most important
dietary protein categories that affect physically active
individuals across domains such as exercise performance,
body composition, protein timing, recommended intakes,
protein sources and quality, and the preparation methods
of various proteins.
benefits on exercise performance
most of the scientific research investigating the effects
of protein intake on exercise performance has focused
on supplemental protein intake. from a broad perspec-
tive, the dependent measures of these studies can be
categorized into two domains:
/c15endurance exercise performance
/c15resistance exercise performance (increases in
maximal strength)
endurance exercise performance
very few studies have investigated the effects of
prolonged periods (one week or more) of dietary protein
manipulation on endurance performance. macdermid
and colleagues compared the influence of an isoener-
getic, high-protein/moderat e-carbohydrate diet (3.3 and
5.9 g of protein and carbohydrate/kg body weight per day,
respectively) with a diet that was more typical of anendurance athlete (1.3 and 7.9 g of protein and carbohy-
drate/kg body weight per day, respectively) in endurance-
trained cyclists. the trained cyclists ingested each diet for a
7-day period in a randomized, crossover fashion. before
and following the 7-day diet intervention, a self-paced cyc-
ling endurance time trial was conducted as the primary
measure of exercise performance. at the end of the treat-
ment period, it took cyclists on the higher protein diet 20%
more time to complete the self-paced time trial - signifi-
cantly longer than for those on the lower protein/higher
carbohydrate diet. this finding is not surprising given that
dietary protein is not a preferred energy source and the
dietary carbohydrate intakes in the higher protein treat-
ment were below recommended intakes for endurance ath-
letes (6 –10 g of carbohydrate/kg/d) . it should be noted
however that a 7-day treatment period is exceedingly brief.
it is unknown what the effect of a higher protein diet would
be over the course of several weeks or months.
in another study utilizing highly trained cyclists dur-
ing a period of increased training intensity, it was ob-
served that 3 g of protein/kg/d offered no improvements
in a simulated time trial as compared to 1.5 g of protein/
kg body weight/day. carbohydrate intake was kept con-
stant (6 g/kg/d) in both the moderate and high protein
treatments during this three-week intervention. although
the number of investigations is limited, it appears as if in-
creasing protein intakes above recommended intakes does
not enhance endurance performance [2, 4, 5].
in addition to these studies that spanned one to three
weeks, several acute-response (single feeding and exercise
sessions) studies exist, during which protein was added to a
carbohydrate beverage prior to or during endurance exercise.
similarly, most of these interventions also reported no added
improvements in endurance performance when protein was
added to a carbohydrate beverage as compared to carbohy-
drate alone [6 –9]. an important research design note, how-
ever, is that those studies which reported improvements in8) while it is possible for physically active individuals to obtain their daily protein requirements through the
consumption of whole foods, supplementation is a practical way of ensuring intake of adequate protein quality
and quantity, while minimizing caloric intake, particularly for athletes who typically complete high volumes of
training.
9) rapidly digested proteins that contain high proportions of essential amino acids (eaas) and adequate leucine,
are most effective in stimulating mps.
10) different types and quality of protein can affect amino acid bioavailability following protein
supplementation.
11) athletes should consider focusing on whole food sources of protein that contain all of the eaas (i.e., it is the
eaas that are required to stimulate mps).
12) endurance athletes should focus on achieving adequate carbohydrate intake to promote optimal performance;
the addition of protein may help to offset muscle damage and promote recovery.
13) pre-sleep casein protein intake (30 –40 g) provides increases in overnight mps and metabolic rate
without influencing lipolysis.jäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 2 of 25endurance performance when protein was added to a carbo-
hydrate beverage before and during exercise all used a time-
to-exhaustion test [10 –12]. when specifically interested in
performance outcomes, a time trial is preferred as it better
mimics competition and pacing demands.
in conclusion, added protein does not appear to im-
prove endurance performance when given for several
days, weeks, or immediately prior to and during endur-
ance exercise. while no ergogenic outcomes may be evi-
dent, the scientific literature is consistent in reporting that
adding protein to a carbohydrate beverage/gel during ex-
haustive endurance exercise suppresses markers of muscle
damage (creatine kinase) 12 to 24 h post-exercise [8, 11 –
13] and decreases the endurance athletes ’feelings of mus-
cular soreness [6 –8, 13]. for these reasons, it seems pru-
dent to recommend for endurance athletes to ingest
approximately 0.25 g of protein/kg body weight per hour
of endurance exercise (in addition to the athlete ’sr e g u l a r
carbohydrate intake) to suppress markers of muscle dam-
age and improve subjective feelings of muscular soreness
[11, 12]. another important consideration relates to the
impact of ingesting protein along with carbohydrate on
rates of protein synthesis and balance during prolonged
bouts of endurance exercise. beelen and colleagues 
determined that adding protein to carbohydrate consump-
tion throughout a prolonged bout of endurance exercise
promotes a higher whole body net protein balance, but
the added protein does not exert any further impact on
rates of mps. while performance outcomes were not
measured, these results shift the focus of nutrient inges-
tion during prolonged bouts of endurance exercise to the
ingestion of carbohydrate.
key points
/c15when adequate carbohydrate is delivered, adding
protein to carbohydrate does not appear to improve
endurance performance over the course of a few
days or weeks.
/c15adding protein during or after an intensive bout of
endurance exercise may suppress the rise in plasma
proteins linked to myofibrillar damage and reduce
feelings of muscle soreness.
/c15there are relatively few investigations on the effects
of protein supplementation on endurance
performance.
resistance exercise performance
the extent to which protein supplementation, in
conjunction with resistance training, enhances maximal
strength is contingent upon many factors, including:
/c15resistance-training program variables
(such as intensity, volume, and progression)/c15length of the resistance-training program/
intervention
/c15training status of the participants engaging in the
resistance-training program
/c15energy intake in the diet
/c15quality and quantity of protein intake (with an
emphasis on leucine content of the protein)
/c15co-ingestion of additional dietary ingredients that
may favorably impact strength (e.g. creatine, hmb)
taking each of these variables into consideration, the
effects of supplemental protein consumption has on
maximal strength enhancement are varied, with a majority
of the investigations reporting no benefit [15 –25] and a
few reporting improvements in maximal strength [26 –29].
with limited exceptions [16, 18, 23, 27], most of the stud-
ies utilized young, healthy, untrained males as partici-
pants. in one investigation examining college football
athletes supplementing with a proprietary milk protein
supplement (two servings of 42 g per day) for 12 weeks, a
14.5% increase in maximal squat strength was observed
compared to a 6.9% increase in the placebo group .
these differences were statistically significant. when
females were the only sex investigated, the outcomes
consistently indicated that supplemental protein does not
appear to enhance maximal strength at magnitudes that
reach statistical significance. hida et al. reported that
females supplementing with 15 g of egg white protein
(which raised daily protein intake to 1.23 g of protein/kg
body weight/day) experienced no improvements in max-
imal upper and lower body strength as compared to a
carbohydrate placebo (ingesting one gram of protein/kg
body weight/day) over an 8-week period. an important
note for this study is that 15 g of egg protein is considered
by many to be a sub-optimal dose . however, others
have advocated that the total daily intake of protein might
be as important or more important . in another study,
josse et al. reported that non-resistance trained fe-
males supplementing with one liter of skimmed bovine
milk (providing 36 g of protein) after resistance exercise
improved maximal strength in seven of nine measures as
compared to a carbohydrate placebo group, but only the
improvements to maximal bench press strength attained
statistical significance compared to the placebo. in
contrast, taylor and colleagues reported that pre- and
post-exercise whey protein ingestion significantly in-
creased maximal upper-body strength (+4.9 kg bench
press one repetition maximum) in comparison to changes
seen when a maltodextrin placebo (+2.3 kg) was ingested
in a group of female collegiate basketball players over an
8-week period.
in summary, while research investigating the addition
of supplemental protein to a diet with adequate energy
and nutrient intakes is inconclusive in regards tojäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 3 of 25stimulating strength gains in conjunction with a
resistance-training program to a statistically significant
degree, greater protein intakes that are achieved from
both dietary and supplemental sources do appear to have
some advantage. hoffman and colleagues reported
that in athletes consuming daily protein intakes above
2.0 g/kg/d which included protein intakes from both diet
and supplements, a 22% and 42% increase in strength
was noted in both the squat and bench press exercises
during off-season conditioning in college football players
compared to athletes that consumed only the recom-
mended levels (1.6 –1.8 g/kg/d) for strength/power
athletes. further, it is important to highlight that in most
studies cited, protein intervention resulted in greater but
non-statistically significant strength improvements as
compared to the placebo/control condition. cermak and
colleagues pooled the outcomes from 22 separate
clinical trials to yield 680 subjects in their statistical
analysis and found that protein supplementation with
resistance training resulted in a 13.5 kg increase (95%
confidence interval: 6.4 –20.7 kg) in lower-body strength
when compared to changes seen when a placebo was
provided. a similar conclusion was also drawn by
pasiakos et al. in a meta-analysis where they
reported that in untrained participants, protein sup-
plementation might exert very little benefit on
strength during the initial weeks of a resistance train-
ing program, but as duration, frequency and volume
of resistance training increased, protein supplementa-
tion may favorably impact skeletal muscle hyper-
trophy and strength.
key points:
/c15results from many single investigations indicate that
in both men and women protein supplementation
exerts a small to modest impact on strength
development.
/c15pooled results of multiple studies using meta-analytic
and other systematic approaches consistently indicate
that protein supplementation (15 to 25 g over 4 to
21 weeks) exerts a positive impact on performance.
body composition
improving one ’s body composition through the loss of
fat mass and increasing fat-free mass is often associated
with improvements in physical performance. in this re-
spect, many published investigations report that protein
supplementation results in significant improvements in
lean body weight/cross-sectional areas as compared to
placebo treatments [15, 17, 21 –23, 26, 27, 33, 37].
andersen et al. examined 22 healthy men that
completed a 14-week resistance-training program
(3 days/week consisting of 3 –4 sets of lower bodyexercises) while supplementing with either 25 g of a
high-quality protein blend or 25 g of carbohydrate.
when the blend of milk proteins was provided, signifi-
cantly greater increases in fat-free mass, muscle cross-
sectional area in both the type i and type ii muscle
fibers occurred when compared to changes seen with
carbohydrate consumption. collectively, a meta-analysis
by cermak and colleagues reported a mean increase
in fat-free mass of 0.69 kg (95% confidence interval:
0.47 –0.91 kg) when protein supplementation was
provided versus a placebo during a resistance-training
program. other reviews by tipton, phillips and pasiakos,
respectively, [36, 38, 39] provide further support that
protein supplementation (15 –25 g over 4 –14 weeks)
augments lean mass accretion when combined with
completion of a resistance training program.
beyond accretion of fat-free mass, increasing daily
protein intake through a combination of food and
supplementation to levels above the recommended daily
allowance (rda) (rda 0.8 g/kg/day, increasing to 1.2 –
2.4 g/kg/day for the endurance and strength/power ath-
letes) while restricting energy intake (30 –40% reduction
in energy intake) has been demonstrated to maximize
the loss of fat tissue while also promoting the mainten-
ance of fat-free mass [40 –45]. the majority of this work
has been conducted using overweight and obese individ-
uals who were prescribed an energy-restricted diet that
delivered a greater ratio of protein relative to carbohy-
drate. as a classic example, layman and investigators
 randomized obese women to consume one of two
restricted energy diets (1600 –1700 kcals/day) that were
either higher in carbohydrates (>3.5: carbohydrate-to-
protein ratio) or protein (<1.5: carbohydrate-to-protein ra-
tio). groups were further divided into those that followed
a five-day per week exercise program (walking + resistance
training, 20 –50 min/workout) and a control group that
performed light walking of less than 100 min per week.
greater amounts of fat were lost when higher amounts of
protein were ingested, but even greater amounts of fat loss
occurred when the exercise program was added to the
high-protein diet group, resulting in significant decreases
in body fat. using an active population that ranged from
normal weight to overweight (bmi: 22 –29 kg/m2),
pasiakos and colleagues examined the impact of pro-
gressively increasing dietary protein over a 21-day study
period. an aggressive energy reduction model was
employed that resulted in each participant reducing their
caloric intake by 30% and increasing their energy expend-
iture by 10%. each person was randomly assigned to
consume a diet that contained either 1× (0.8 g/kg), 2×
(1.6 g/kg) or 3× (2.4 g/kg) the rda for protein. partici-
pants were measured for changes in body weight and body
composition. while the greatest body weight loss occurred
in the 1× rda group, this group also lost the highestjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 4 of 25percentage of fat-free mass and lowest percentage of fat
mass. the 2× and 3× rda groups lost significant amounts
of body weight that consisted of 70% and 64% fat mass,
respectively.
collectively, these results indicate that increasing
dietary protein can promote favorable adaptations in
body composition through the promotion of fat-free
mass accretion when combined with a hyperenergetic
diet and a heavy resistance training program and can
also promote the loss of fat mass when higher intakes of
daily protein (2-3× the rda) are combined with an
exercise program and a hypoenergetic diet.
key points:
/c15when combined with a hyperenergetic diet and a
heavy resistance-training program, protein
supplementation may promote increases in skeletal
muscle cross-sectional area and lean body mass.
/c15when combined with a resistance-training program
and a hypoenergetic diet, an elevated daily intake of
protein (2 –3× the rda) can promote greater
losses of fat mass and greater overall improvements
in body composition.
protein timing
thanks to seminal work by pioneering research groups
[37, 46, 47], by the 1990 ’s it was clear that exercise and
macronutrient consumption interact synergistically to
provide a net anabolic effect far greater than either feed-
ing or exercise alone. in the absence of feeding, muscle
protein balance remains negative in response to an acute
bout of resistance exercise . tipton et al. were
one of the first groups to illustrate that an acute feeding
of amino acids significantly increases rates of muscle
protein synthesis (mps). later, burd et al. indicated
that the combination of acute, exhaustive resistance
exercise increases the muscle ’s anabolic responsiveness
to whey protein provision for up to 24 h. in addition to
heightened anabolic sensitivity that stems from the
combination of resistance exercise and protein/amino
acid feeding, the importance of the eaas with respect
to muscle protein growth has also been elucidated.
tipton et al. first indicated that nonessential amino
acids were not necessary to stimulate mps. subse-
quently, these conclusions were supported by borsheim
 and volpi . the study by borsheim also docu-
mented a dose-response outcome characterized by a
near doubling of net protein balance in response to a
three to six gram dose of the eaas . building on this
work, tipton et al. reported that eaas (9 –15 g
dose) before and after resistance exercise promoted
higher net protein accretion, not just 3 or 4 h post exer-
cise but also over a 24-h period . these findingsformed the theoretical concept of protein timing for
resistance exercise that has since been transferred to not
only other short-duration, high-intensity activities 
but also endurance-based sports and subsequent
performance outcomes . the strategic consumption
of nutrition, namely protein or various forms of amino
acids, in the hours immediately before and during
exercise (i.e., peri-workout nutrition) has been shown to
maximize muscle repair and optimize strength- and
hypertrophy-related adaptations [59, 60]. while earlier
investigations reported positive effects from consump-
tion of amino acids [37, 46, 61], it is now clear that
intact protein supplements such as egg, whey, casein,
beef, soy and even whole milk can evoke an anabolic
response that can be similar or greater in magnitude
to free form amino acids, assuming ingestion of equal
eaa amounts [62 –64].
for instance, whey protein ingested close to resistance
exercise, promotes a higher activation (phosphorylation)
of mtor (a key signaling protein found in myocytes
that is linked to the synthesis of muscle proteins) and its
downstream mrna translational signaling proteins (i.e.,
p70s6 kinase and eif4bp) that further suggests timed in-
gestion of protein may favorably promote heightened
muscle hypertrophy [21, 62]. moreover, it was found that
the increased mtor signaling corresponded with
significantly greater muscle hypertrophy after 10 weeks
of training . however, the hypertrophic differences
between protein consumption and a non-caloric placebo
appeared to plateau by week 21, despite a persistently
greater activation of this molecular signaling pathway
from supplementation. results from other research
groups [56 –58, 66] show that timing of protein near
(± 2 h) aerobic and anaerobic exercise training ap-
pears to provide a greater activation of the molecular
signalling pathways that regulate myofibrillar and
mitochondrial protein synthesis as well as glycogen
synthesis.
it is widely reported that protein consumption directly
after resistance exercise is an effective way to acutely
promote a positive muscle protein balance [31, 55, 67],
which if repeated over time should translate into a net
gain or hypertrophy of muscle . pennings and col-
leagues reported an increase in both the delivery
and incorporation of dietary proteins into the skeletal
muscle of young and older adults when protein was
ingested shortly after completion of exercise. these
findings and others add to the theoretical basis for
consumption of post-protein sooner rather than later
after exercise, since post workout mps rates peak within
three hours and remain elevated for an additional 24 –
72 h [50, 70]. this extended time frame also provides a
rationale for both immediate and sustained (i.e., every
3–4 h) feedings to optimize impact. these temporaljäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 5 of 25considerations would also capture the peak elevation in
signalling proteins shown to be pivotal for increasing the
initiation of translation of muscle proteins, which for the
most part appears to peak between 30 and 60 min after
exercise . finally, while some investigations have
shown that a rapid increase in amino acids (aminoacide-
mia) from a protein dose immediately after or surround-
ing exercise stimulates increased adaptations to resistance
training [72, 73], others examining competitive strength/
power athletes reported no advantage from pre/post sup-
plement feedings compared to similar feedings in morning
and evening hours . however, these differences may
be related to the type of protein used between the studies.
the studies showing positive effects of protein timing
used milk proteins, whereas the latter study used a colla-
gen based protein supplement.
while a great deal of work has focused on post-
exercise protein ingestion, other studies have suggested
that pre-exercise and even intra-exercise ingestion may
also support favorable changes in mps and muscle
protein breakdown [14, 54, 75 –78]. initially, tipton and
colleagues directly compared immediate pre-
exercise and immediate post-exercise ingestion of a mix-
ture of carbohydrate (35 g) and eaas (6 g) combination
on changes in mps. they reported that pre-exercise
ingestion promoted higher rates of mps while also
demonstrating that nutrient ingestion prior to exercise
increased nutrient delivery to a much greater extent
than other (immediate or one hour post-exercise)
time points. these results were later challenged by
fujita in 2009 who employed an identical study de-
sign with a different tracer incorporation approach
and concluded there was no difference between pre-
or post-exercise ingestion . subsequent work by
tipton also found that similar elevated rates of
mps were achieved when ingesting 20 g of a whey
protein isolate immediately before or immediately
after resistance exercise.
at this point, whether any particular time of protein
ingestion confers any unique advantage over other time
points throughout a 24-h day to improve strength and
hypertrophy has yet to be adequately investigated. to
date, although a substantial amount of literature dis-
cusses this concept [60, 80], a limited number of training
studies have assessed whether immediate pre- and post-
exercise protein consumption provides unique advan-
tages compared to other time points [72, 73, 81]. each
study differed in population, training program, environ-
ment and nutrition utilized, with each reporting a
different result. what is becoming clear is that the
subject population, nutrition habits, dosing protocols on
both training and non-training days, energy and macro-
nutrient intake, as well as the exercise bout or training
program itself should be carefully considered alongsidethe results. in particular, the daily amount of protein intake
seems to operate as a key consideration because the bene-
fits of protein timing in relation to the peri-workout period
seem to be lessened for people who are already ingesting
appropriate amounts of protein (e.g. ≥1.6 g/kg/day). this
observation can be seen when comparing the initial
results of cribb , hoffman and most recently
with schoenfeld ; however, one must also consider
that the participants in the hoffman study may have
been hypocaloric as they reported consuming approxi-
mately 30 kcal/kg in all groups across the entire
study. a literature review by aragon and schoenfeld
 determined that while compelling evidence exists
showing muscle is sensitized to protein ingestion
following training, the increased sensitivity to protein
ingestion might be greatest in the first five to six
hours following exercise. thus, the importance of
timing may be largely dependent on when a pre-
workout meal was consumed, the size and compos-
ition of that meal and the total daily protein in the
diet. in this respect, a pre-exercise meal will provide
amino acids during and after exercise and therefore it
stands to reason there is less need for immediate
post-exercise protein ingestion if a pre-exercise meal
is consumed less than five hours before the antici-
pated completion of a workout. a meta-analysis by
schoenfeld et al. found that consuming protein
within one-hour post resistance exercise had a small
but significant effect on increasing muscle hyper-
trophy compared to delaying consumption by at least
two hours. however, sub-analysis of these results re-
vealed the effect all but disappeared after controlling
for the total intake of protein, indicating that favor-
able effects were due to unequal protein intake be-
tween the experimenta la n dc o n t r o lg r o u p s( ∼1.7 g/kg
versus 1.3 g/kg, respectively) as opposed to temporal
aspects of feeding. the authors concluded that total
protein intake was the strongest predictor of muscular
hypertrophy and that protein timing likely influences
hypertrophy to a lesser degree. however, the conclu-
sions from this meta-analysis may be questioned
because the majority of the studies analyzed were not
protein timing studies but rather protein supplemen-
tation studies. in that respect, the meta-analysis
provides evidence that protein supplementation (i.e.,
greater total daily protein intake) may indeed confer
an anabolic effect. while a strong rationale remains
to support the concept that the hours immediately
before or after resistance exercise represents an op-
p o r t u n et i m et od e l i v e rk e yn u t r i e n t st h a tw i l ld r i v e
the accretion of fat-free mass and possibly other fa-
vorable adaptations, the majority of available literature
suggests that other factors may indeed be operating
to a similar degree that ultimately impact thejäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 6 of 25observed adaptations. in this respect, a key variable
that must be accounted for is the absolute need for
energy and protein required to appropriately set the
body up to accumulate fat-free mass.
a review by bosse and dixon critically summa-
rized the available literature on protein supplementation
during resistance exercise and hypothesized that protein
intake may need to increase by as much as 59% above
baseline levels for significant changes in fat-free mass to
occur. finally, it should be noted that for many athletes,
consuming a post- or pre-workout protein-containing
meal represents a feeding opportunity with little down-
side, since there is no benefit from not consuming
protein pre- and/or post-exercise. in other words, not
consuming protein-containing foods/supplements post-
exercise is a strategy that provides no benefit whatso-
ever. thus, the most practical recommendation is to
have athletes consume a meal during the post-workout
(or pre-workout) time period since it may either help or
have a neutral effect.
in younger subjects, the ingestion of 20 –30 g of any
high biological value protein before or after resistance
exercise appears to be sufficient to maximally stimulate
mps [21, 64]. more recently, macnaughton and col-
leagues reported that 40 g of whey protein ingestion
significantly increased the mps responses compared to a
20 g feeding after an acute bout of whole-body resist-
ance exercise, and that the absolute protein dose may
operate as a more important consideration than provid-
ing a protein dose that is normalized to lean mass. free
form eaas, soy, milk, whey, caseinate, and other protein
hydrolysates are all capable of activating mps .
however, maximal stimulation of mps, which results in
higher net muscle protein accretion, is the product of
the total amount of eaa in circulation as well as the
pattern and appearance rate of aminoacidemia that mod-
ulates the mps response . recent work has clarified
that whey protein provides a distinct advantage over
other protein sources including soy (considered another
fast absorbing protein) and casein (a slower acting
protein source) on acute stimulation of mps [86, 87].
importantly, an elegant study by west and investigators
 sought to match the delivery of eaas in feeding
patterns that replicated how whey and casein are
digested. the authors reported that a 25 g dose of whey
protein that promoted rapid aminoacidemia further
enhanced mps and anabolic signaling when compared
to an identical total dose of whey protein when delivered
as ten separate 2.5 g doses intended to replicate a slower
digesting protein. the advantages of whey protein are
important to consider, particularly as all three sources
rank similarly in assessments of protein quality . in
addition to soy, other plant sources (e.g., pea, rice, hemp,
etc.) have garnered interest as potential protein sourcesto consider. unfortunately, research that examines the
ability of these protein sources to modulate exercise
performance and training adaptations is limited at this
time. one study conducted by joy and investigators 
compared the effect of supplementing a high-dose (48 g/
day) of whey or rice protein in experienced resistance-
trained subjects during an 8-week resistance training
program. the investigators concluded that gains in
strength, muscle thickness and body composition were
similar between the two protein groups, suggesting that
rice protein may be a suitable alternative to whey
protein at promoting resistance training adaptations.
furthermore, differences in absorption kinetics, and the
subsequent impact on muscle protein metabolism
appear to extend beyond the degree of hydrolysis and
amino acid profiles [69, 86, 90 –92]. for instance, unlike
soy more of the eaas from whey proteins (hydrolysates
and isolates) survive splanchnic uptake and travel to the
periphery to activate a higher net gain in muscle .
whey proteins (hydrolysates and isolates) appear to be
the most extensively researched for pre/post resistance
exercise supplementation, possibly because of their
higher eaa and leucine content [93, 94], solubility, and
optimal digestion kinetics . these characteristics
yield a high concentration of amino acids in the blood
(aminoacidemia) [69, 87] that facilitates greater
activation of mps and net muscle protein accretion, in
direct comparison to other protein choices [50, 69, 91].
the addition of creatine to whey protein supplemen-
tation appears to further augment these adaptations
[27, 72, 95]; however, an optimal timing strategy for
this combination remains unclear.
the timing of protein-rich meals consumed through-
out a day has the potential to influence adaptations to
exercise. using similar methods, other studies over re-
cent decades [53, 62, 87, 91, 96 –100] have established
the following:
/c15mps increases approximately 30 –100% in response
to a protein-containing meal to promote a positive
net protein balance, and the major contributing
factor to this response is the eaa content.
/c15the anabolic response to feeding is pronounced but
transient. during the post-prandial phase (1 –4h
after a meal) mps is elevated, resulting in a positive
muscle protein balance. in contrast, mps rates are
lower in a fasted state and muscle protein balance is
negative. protein accretion only occurs in the fed
state. the concentration of eaa in the blood
(plasma) regulates protein synthesis rates within
muscle at rest and post exercise. more recent work
has established that protein-carbohydrate supple-
mentation after strenuous endurance exercise
stimulates contractile mps via similar signalingjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 7 of 25pathways as resistance exercise [ 56,57]. most
importantly, and as mentioned initially in this
section, muscle appears to be “sensitized ”to protein
feeding for at least 24 h after exercise [ 50]. that is,
the consumption of a protein-containing meal up to
24 h after a single bout of resistance exercise results
in a higher net stimulation of mps and protein
accretion than the same meal consumed after 24 h
of inactivity [ 50].
/c15the effect of insulin on mps is dependent on its
ability to increase amino acid availability, which does
not occur when insulin is systematically increased
(e.g., following feeding) [ 101]. in particular, insulin ’s
impact on net protein balance seems to operate
most powerfully in an anti-catabolic manner on
muscle [ 102]. however, insulin-mediated effects that
reduce muscle protein breakdown peaks at low to
moderate levels of insulin (~15 –30μiu/ml)
[103,104] that can be achieved by consumption of a
45-g dose of whey protein isolate alone [ 105]. taken
together, these results seem to indicate that post-
workout carbohydrate supplementation offers very
little contribution from a muscle development
standpoint provided adequate protein is consumed.
for example, staples and colleagues [ 106] compared
the impact of a carbohydrate + protein combination
on rates of mps and reported no further increases in
mps beyond what was seen with protein ingestion
alone. importantly, these results are not to be
interpreted to mean that carbohydrate administration
offers no potential effect for an athlete engaging in
moderate to high volumes of training, but rather that
benefits derived from carbohydrate administration
appear to more favorably impact aspects of muscle
glycogen recovery as opposed to stimulating muscle
protein accretion.
pre-sleep protein intake
eating before sleep has long been controversial [107 –109].
however, a methodological consideration in the original
studies such as the population used, time of feeding, and
size of the pre-sleep meal confounds firm conclusions
about benefits or drawbacks. recent work using protein-
rich beverages 30-min prior to sleep and two hours after
the last meal (dinner) have identified pre-sleep protein
consumption/ingestion as advantageous to mps, muscle
recovery, and overall metabolism in both acute and long-
term studies [110, 111]. results from several investigations
indicate that 30 –40 g of casein protein ingested 30-min
prior to sleep or via nasogastric tubing 
increased overnight mps in both young and old men,
respectively. likewise, in an acute setting, 30 g of whey
protein, 30 g of casein protein, and 33 g of carbohydrate
consumed 30-min prior to sleep resulted in an elevatedmorning resting metabolic rate in young fit men com-
pared to a non-caloric placebo . similarly, although
not statistically significant, morning increases in resting
metabolic rate were reported in young overweight and/or
obese women . interestingly, madzima et al. 
reported that subjects ’respiratory quotient measured
during the morning after pre-sleep nutrient intake was
unchanged only for the placebo and casein protein trials,
while both carbohydrate and whey protein were increased
compared to placebo. this infers that casein protein
consumed pre-sleep maintains overnight lipolysis and fat
oxidation. this finding was further supported by kinsey et
al. using a microdialysis technique to measure inter-
stitial glycerol concentrations overnight from the subcuta-
neous abdominal adipose tissue, reporting greater fat
oxidation following consumption of 30 g of casein com-
pared to a flavor and sensory-matched noncaloric placebo
in obese men. similar to madzima et al. , kinsey et
al. concluded that pre-sleep casein did not blunt
overnight lipolysis or fat oxidation. interestingly, the pre-
sleep protein and carbohydrate ingestion resulted in
elevated insulin concentrations the next morning and
decreased hunger in this overweight population. of note,
it appears that exercise training completely ameliorates
any rise in insulin when eating at night before sleep ,
while the combination of pre-sleep protein and exercise
has been shown to reduce blood pressure and arterial
stiffness in young obese women with prehypertension and
hypertension . in athletes, evening chocolate milk
consumption has also been shown to influence carbohy-
drate metabolism in the morning, but not running per-
formance . in addition, data supports that exercise
performed in the evening augments the overnight mps
response in both younger and older men [119 –121].
to date, only a few studies involving nighttime protein
ingestion have been carried out for longer than four
weeks. snijders et al. randomly assigned young
men (average age of 22 years) to consume a protein-
centric supplement (27.5 g of casein protein, 15 g of
carbohydrate, and 0.1 g of fat) or a noncaloric placebo
every night before sleep while also completing a 12-week
progressive resistance exercise training program (3 times
per week). the group receiving the protein-centric sup-
plement each night before sleep had greater improve-
ments in muscle mass and strength over the 12-week
study. of note, this study was non-nitrogen balanced
and the protein group received approximately 1.9 g/kg/
day of protein compared to 1.3 g/kg/day in the placebo
group. more recently, in a study in which total protein
intake was equal, antonio et al. studied young
healthy men and women that supplemented with casein
protein (54 g) for 8 weeks either in the morning (any
time before 12 pm) or the evening supplementation
(90 min or less prior to sleep). they examined thejäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 8 of 25effects on body composition and performance . all
subjects maintained their usual exercise program. the
authors reported no differences in body composition or
performance between the morning and evening casein
supplementation groups. however, it is worth noting
that, although not statistically significant, the morning
group added 0.4 kg of fat free mass while the evening
protein group added 1.2 kg of fat free mass, even though
the habitual diet of the trained subjects in this study
consumed 1.7 to 1.9 g/kg/day of protein. although this
finding was not statistically significant, it supports data
from burk et al. indicating that casein-based protein
consumed in the morning (10 am) and evening
(10:30 pm) was more beneficial for increasing fat-free
mass than consuming the protein supplement in the
morning (10 am) and afternoon (~3:50 pm). it should be
noted that the subjects in the burk et al. study were
resistance training. a retrospective epidemiological study
by buckner et al. using nhanes data (1999 –
2002) showed that participants consuming 20, 25, or
30 g of protein in the evening had greater leg lean mass
compared to subjects consuming protein in the after-
noon. thus, it appears that protein consumption in the
evening before sleep might be an underutilized time to
take advantage of a protein feeding opportunity that can
potentially improve body composition and performance.
protein ingestion and meal timing
in addition to direct assessments of timed administration of
nutrients, other studies have explored questions that center
upon the pattern of when certai n protein-containing meals
are consumed. paddon-jones et al. reported a correl-
ation between acute stimulat ion of mps via protein con-
sumption and chronic changes in muscle mass. in this
study, participants were given an eaa supplement three
times a day for 28 days. results indicated that acute stimu-
lation of mps provided by the supplement on day 1 re-
sulted in a net gain of ~7.5 g of muscle over a 24-h period
. when extrapolated over the entire 28-day study, the
predicted change in muscle mass corresponded to the ac-
tual change in muscle mass (~210 g) measured by dual-
energy x-ray absorptiometry (dexa) . while these
findings are important, it is vital to highlight that this study
incorporated a bed rest model with no acute exercise
stimulus while other work by mitchell et al. reported
a lack of correlation between measures of acute mps and
the accretion of skeletal muscle mass.
interestingly, supplementation with 15 g of eaas and
30 g of carbohydrate produced a greater anabolic effect (in-
crease in net phenylalanine balance) than the ingestion of a
mixed macronutrient meal, despi te the fact that both inter-
ventions contained a similar dose of eaas . most im-
portantly, the consumption of the supplement did not
interfere with the normal anabolic response to the mealconsumed three hours later . the results of these inves-
tigations suggest that protei n supplement timing between
the regular “t h r e es q u a r em e a l sad a y ”may provide an addi-
tive effect on net protein accretion due to a more frequent
stimulation of mps. areta et al. were the first to
examine the anabolic response in human skeletal muscle to
various protein feeding strategies for a day after a single
bout of resistance exercise. the researchers compared the
anabolic responses of three di fferent patterns of ingestion
(a total of 80 g of protein) throughout a 12-h recovery
period after resistance exercise. using a group of healthy
young adult males, the protein feeding strategies consisted
of small pulsed (8 × 10 g), intermediate (4 × 20 g), or bolus
(2 × 40 g) administration of whey protein over the 12-h
measurement window. results showed that the intermedi-
ate dosing (4 × 20 g) was superior for stimulating mps for
the 12-h experimental period. specifically, the rates of myo-
fibrillar protein synthesis were optimized throughout the
day of recovery by the consumption of 20 g protein every
three hours compared to large (2 × 40 g), less frequent
servings or smaller but more frequent (8 × 10 g) patterns of
protein intake . previously , the effect of various protein
feeding strategies on skeletal mps during an entire day was
unknown. this study provided novel information demon-
strating that the regulation of mps can be modulated by
the timing and distribution of protein over 12 h after a sin-
gle bout of resistance exercise. however, it should be noted
that an 80 g dose of protein ov er a 12-h period is quite low.
the logical next step for researchers is to extend these
findings into longitudinal training studies to see if these
patterns can significantly affect resistance-training
adaptations. indeed, published studies by arnal 
and tinsley have all made some attempt to exam-
ine the impact of adjusting the pattern of protein con-
sumption across the day in combination with various
forms of exercise. collective results from these studies
are mixed. thus, future studies in young adults should
be designed to compare a balanced vs. skewed distribu-
tion pattern of daily protein intake on the daytime
stimulation of mps (under resting and post-exercise
conditions) and training-induced changes in muscle
mass, while taking into consideration the established
optimal dose of protein contained in a single serving for
young adults. without more conclusive evidence
spanning several weeks, it seems pragmatic to recom-
mend the consumption of at least 20-25 g of protein
(~0.25 g/kg/meal) with each main meal with no more
than 3 –4 h between meals .
key points
/c15in the absence of feeding and in response to
resistance exercise, muscle protein balance
remains negative.jäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 9 of 25/c15skeletal muscle is sensitized to the effects of protein
and amino acids for up to 24 h after completion of a
bout of resistance exercise.
/c15a protein dose of 20 –40 g of protein (10 –12 g of
eaas, 1 –3 g of leucine) stimulates mps, which can
help to promote a positive nitrogen balance.
/c15the eaas are critically needed for achieving
maximal rates of mps making high-quality, protein
sources that are rich in eaas and leucine the
preferred sources of protein.
/c15studies have suggested that pre-exercise feedings of
amino acids in combination with carbohydrate can
achieve maximal rates of mps, but protein and
amino acid feedings during this time are not clearly
documented to increase exercise performance.
/c15ingestion of carbohydrate + protein or eaas during
endurance and resistance exercise can help to
maintain a favorable anabolic hormone profile,
minimize increases in muscle damage, promote
increases in muscle cross-sectional area, and
increase time to exhaustion during prolonged
running and cycling.
/c15post-exercise administration of protein when
combined with suboptimal intake of carbohydrates
(<1.2 g/kg/day) can heighten muscle glycogen
recovery, and may help mitigate changes in muscle
damage markers.
/c15total protein and calorie intake appears to be the
most important consideration when it comes to
promoting positive adaptations to resistance
training, and the impact of timing strategies
(immediately before or immediately after) to
heighten these adaptations in non-athletic
populations appears to be minimal.
recommended intake
proteins provide the building blocks of all tissues via
their constituent amino acids. athletes consume dietary
protein to repair and rebuild skeletal muscle and
connective tissues following intense training bouts or
athletic events. during in the 1980s and early 1990 ’s
tarnopolsky , phillips , and lemon first
demonstrated that total protein needs were 50 to 175%
greater in athletes than sedentary controls. a report in
2004 by phillips summarized the findings
surrounding protein requirements in resistance-trained
athletes. using a regression approach, he concluded that
a protein intake of 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight
per day (g/kg/day) should be recommended, and when
the upper limit of a 95% confidence interval was in-
cluded the amount approached 1.33 g/kg/day. a key
consideration regarding these recommended values is
that all generated data were obtained using the nitrogen
balance technique, which is known to underestimateprotein requirements. interestingly, two of the included
papers had prescribed protein intakes of 2.4 and 2.5 g/kg/
day, respectively [129, 133]. all data points from these two
studies also had the highest levels of positive nitrogen
balance. for an athlete seeking to ensure an anabolic en-
vironment, higher daily protein intakes might be needed.
another challenge that underpins the ability to universally
and successfully recommend daily protein amounts are
factors related to the volume of the exercise program, age,
body composition and training status of the athlete; as
well as the total energy intake in the diet, particularly for
athletes who desire to lose fat and are restricting calories
to accomplish this goal . for these reasons, and due
to an increase of published studies in areas related to opti-
mal protein dosing, timing and composition, protein
needs are being recommended within this position stand
on a per meal basis.
for example, moore found that muscle and albu-
min protein synthesis was optimized at approximately
20 g of egg protein at rest. witard et al. provided
incremental doses of whey protein (0, 10, 20 and 40 g)
in conjunction with an acute bout of resistance exercise
and concluded that a minimum protein dose of 20 g
optimally promoted mps rates. finally, yang and
colleagues had 37 elderly men (average age of
71 years) consume incremental doses of whey protein
isolate (0, 10, 20 and 40 g/dose) in combination with a
single bout of lower body resistance exercise and con-
cluded that a 40 g dose of whey protein isolate is needed
in this population to maximize rates of mps. further-
more, while results from these studies offer indications
of what optimal absolute dosing amounts may be,
phillips concluded that a relative dose of 0.25 g of
protein per kg of body weight per dose might operate as
an optimal supply of high-quality protein. once a total
daily target protein intake has been achieved, the
frequency and pattern with which optimal doses are
ingested may serve as a key determinant of overall
changes in protein synthetic rates.
research indicates that rates of mps rapidly rise to
peak levels within 30 min of protein ingestion and are
maintained for up to three hours before rapidly begin-
ning to lower to basal rates of mps even though amino
acids are still elevated in the blood . using an oral
ingestion model of 48 g of whey protein in healthy
young men, rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis
increased three-fold within 45 –90 min before slowly
declining to basal rates of mps all while plasma concen-
tration of eaas remained significantly elevated .
while human models have not fully explored the mech-
anistic basis of this ‘muscle-full ’phenomenon, an energy
deficit theory has been proposed which hypothesizes
that rates of mps were blunted even though plasma
concentrations of amino acids remained elevatedjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 10 of 25because a relative lack of cellular atp was available to
drive the synthetic process . while largely unex-
plored in a human model, these authors relied upon an
animal model and were able to reinstate increases in
mps using the consumption of leucine and carbohydrate
135 min after ingestion of the first meal. as such, it is
suggested that individuals attempting to restrict caloric
intake should consume three to four whole meals
consisting of 20 –40 g of protein per meal. while this
recommendation stems primarily from initial work that
indicated protein doses of 20 –40 g favorably promote in-
creased rates of mps [31, 135, 136], kim and colleagues
 recently reported that a 70 g dose of protein pro-
moted a more favorable net balance of protein when
compared to a 40 g dose due to a stronger attenuation
of rates of muscle protein breakdown.
for those attempting to increase their calories, we sug-
gest consuming small snacks between meals consisting
of both a complete protein and a carbohydrate source.
this contention is supported by research from paddon-
jones et al. that used a 28-day bed rest model.
these researchers compared three 850-cal mixed macro-
nutrient meals to three 850-cal meals combined with
three 180-cal amino acid-carbohydrate snacks between
meals. results demonstrated that subjects, who also con-
sumed the small snacks, experienced a 23% increase in
muscle protein fractional synthesis and successful main-
tenance of strength throughout the bed rest trial. add-
itionally, using a protein distribution pattern of 20 –25 g
doses every three hours in response to a single bout of
lower body resistance exercise appears to promote the
greatest increase in mps rates and phosphorylation of
key intramuscular proteins linked to muscle hypertrophy
. finally, in a series of experiments, arciero and
colleagues [116, 141] employed a protein pacing strategy
involving equitable distribution of effective doses of pro-
tein (4 –6 meals/day of 20 –40 g per meal) alone and
combined with multicomponent exercise training. using
this approach, their results consistently demonstrate
positive changes in body composition [116, 142] and
physical performance outcomes in both lean [143, 144]
and overweight/obese populations [142, 143, 145]. this
simple addition could provide benefits for individuals
looking to increase muscle mass and improve body
composition in general while also striving to maintain or
improve health and performance.
key points
/c15the current rda for protein is 0.8 g/kg/day with
multiple lines of evidence indicating this value is not
an appropriate amount for a training athlete to meet
their daily needs./c15while previous recommendations have suggested a
daily intake of 1.2 –1.3 g/kg/day is an appropriate
amount, most of this work was completed using the
nitrogen balance technique, which is known to
systematically underestimate protein needs.
/c15daily and per dose needs are combinations of many
factors including volume of exercise, age, body
composition, total energy intake and training status
of the athlete.
/c15daily intakes of 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/day operate as a
minimum recommended amount while greater
amounts may be needed for people attempting to
restrict energy intake while maintaining fat-free mass.
/c15recommendations regarding the optimal protein
intake per serving for athletes to maximize mps are
mixed and are dependent upon age and recent
resistance exercise stimuli. general
recommendations are 0.25 g of a high-quality
protein per kg of body weight, or an absolute
dose of 20 –40 g.
/c15higher doses (~40 g) are likely needed to maximize
mps responses in elderly individuals.
/c15even higher amounts (~70 g) appear to be
necessary to promote attenuation of muscle
protein breakdown.
/c15pacing or spreading these feeding episodes
approximately three hours apart has been
consistently reported to promote sustained,
increased levels of mps and performance benefits.
protein quality
there are 20 total amino acids, comprised of 9 eaas
and 11 non-essential amino acids (neaas). eaas
cannot be produced in the body and therefore must be
consumed in the diet. several methods exist to deter-
mine protein quality such as chemical score, protein
efficiency ratio, biological value, protein digestibility-
corrected amino acid score (pdcaas) and most
recently, the indicator amino acid oxidation (iaao)
technique. ultimately, in vivo protein quality is typically
defined as how effective a protein is at stimulating mps
and promoting muscle hypertrophy . overall, re-
search has shown that products containing animal and
dairy-based proteins contain the highest percentage of
eaas and result in greater hypertrophy and protein syn-
thesis following resistance training when compared to a
vegetarian protein-matched control, which typically
lacks one or more eaas [86, 93, 147].
several studies, but not all, have indicated that
eaas alone stimulate protein synthesis in the same
magnitude as a whole protein with the same eaa con-
tent . for example, borsheim et al. found that
6 g of eaas stimulated protein synthesis twice as much
as a mixture of 3 g of neaas combined with 3 g ofjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 11 of 25eaas. moreover, paddon-jones and colleagues 
found that a 180-cal supplement containing 15 g of
eaas stimulated greater rates of protein synthesis than
an 850-cal meal with the same eaa content from a
whole protein source. while important, the impact of a
larger meal on changes in circulation and the subse-
quent delivery of the relevant amino acids to the muscle
might operate as important considerations when inter-
preting this data. in contrast, katsanos and colleagues
 had 15 elderly subjects consume either 15 g of
whey protein or individual doses of the essential and
nonessential amino acids that were identical to what is
found in a 15-g whey protein dose on separate occasions.
whey protein ingestion significantly increased leg phenyl-
alanine balance, an index of muscle protein accrual, while
eaa and neaa ingestion exerted no significant impact
on leg phenylalanine balance. this study, and the results
reported by others have led to the suggestion that an
approximate 10 g dose of eaas might serve as an optimal
dose to maximally stimulate mps and that intact protein
feedings of appropriate amounts (as opposed to free
amino acids) to elderly individuals may stimulate greater
improvements in leg muscle protein accrual.
based on this research, scientists have also attempted to
determine which of the eaas are primarily responsible
for modulating protein balance. the three branched-chain
amino acids (bcaas), leucine, isoleucine, and valine are
unique among the eaas for their roles in protein metab-
olism , neural function [151 –153], and blood glucose
and insulin regulation . additionally, enzymes re-
sponsible for the degradation of bcaas operate in a rate-
limiting fashion and are found in low levels in splanchnic
tissues . thus, orally ingested bcaas appear rapidly
in the bloodstream and expose muscle to high concentra-
tions ultimately making them key components of skeletal
mps . furthermore, wilson and colleagues 
have recently demonstrated, in an animal model, that leu-
cine ingestion (alone and with carbohydrate) consumed
between meals (135 min post-consumption) extends
protein synthesis by increasing the energy status of the
muscle fiber. multiple human studies have supported the
contention that leucine drives protein synthesis [158, 159].
moreover, this response may occur in a dose-
dependent fashion, plateauing at approximately two g
at rest [31, 157], and increasing up to 3.5 g when
ingestion occurs after completion of a 60-min bout of
moderate intensity cycling . however, it is im-
portant to realize that the duration of protein synthe-
sis after resistance exercise appears to be limited by
both the signal (leucine concentrations), atp status,
as well as the availability of substrate (i.e., additional
eaas found in a whole protein source) . as
such, increasing leucine concentration may stimulate
increases in muscle protein, but a higher total dose ofall eaas (as free form amino acids or intact protein
sources) seems to be most suited for sustaining the
increased rates of mps .
it is well known that exercise improves net muscle
protein balance and in the absence of protein feeding,
this balance becomes more negative. when combined
with protein feeding, net muscle protein balance after
exercise becomes positive . norton and layman
 proposed that consumption of leucine, could
turn a negative protein balance to a positive balance
following an intense exercise bout by prolonging the
mps response to feeding. in support, the ingestion of
a protein or essential amino acid complex that
contains sufficient amounts of leucine has been
shown to shift protein balance to a net positive state
after intense exercise trai ning [46, 150]. even though
leucine has been demonstrated to independently
stimulate protein synthesis, it is important to
recognize that supplementation should not be with
just leucine alone. for instance, wilson et al. 
demonstrated in an animal model that leucine
consumption resulted in a lower duration of protein
synthesis compared to a whole meal. in summary,
athletes should focus on consuming adequate leucine
content in each of their meals through selection of
high-quality protein sources .
key points
/c15protein sources containing higher levels of the eaas
are considered to be higher quality sources of
protein.
/c15the body uses 20 amino acids to make proteins,
seven of which are essential (nine conditionally),
requiring their ingest ion to meet daily needs.
/c15eaas appear to be uniquely responsible for
increasing mps with doses ranging from 6 to 15 g
all exerting stimulatory effects. in addition,
doses of approximately one to three g of
leucine per meal appear to be needed to
stimulate protein translation machinery.
/c15the bcaas (i.e., isoleucine, leucine, and valine)
appear to exhibit individual and collective
abilities to stimulate protein translation. however,
the extent to which these changes are aligned with
changes in mps remains to be fully explored.
/c15while greater doses of leucine have been
shown to independently stimulate increases
in protein synthesis, a balanced consumption
of the eaas promotes the greatest increases.
/c15the prioritization of feedings of protein
with adequate levels of leucine/bcaas
will best promote increases in mps.jäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 12 of 25protein sources
milk proteins
milk proteins have undergone extensive research related
to their potential roles in augmenting adaptations from
exercise training [86, 93]. for example, consuming milk
following exercise has been demonstrated to accelerate
recovery from muscle damaging exercise , increase
glycogen replenishment , improve hydration status
[162, 164], and improve protein balance to favor synthe-
sis [86, 93], ultimately resulting in increased gains in
both neuromuscular strength and skeletal muscle hyper-
trophy . moreover, milk protein contains the highest
score on the pdcaas rating system, and in general
contains the greatest density of leucine . milk can
be fractionated into two protein classes, casein and
whey.
comparison of the quality of whey and casein reveal
that these two proteins routinely contain the highest
leucine content of all other protein sources at 11% and
9.3%, respectively. while both are high in quality, the
two differ in the rate at which they digest as well as the
impact they have on protein metabolism [165 –167].
whey protein is water soluble, mixes easily, and is rap-
idly digested . in contrast, casein is water insoluble,
coagulates in the gut and is digested more slowly than
whey protein . casein also has intrinsic properties
such as opioid peptides, which effectively slow gastric
motility . original research investigating the effects
of digestion rate was conducted by boirie, dangin and
colleagues [165 –167]. these researchers gave a 30 g
bolus of whey protein and a 43 g bolus of casein protein
to subjects on separate occasions and measured amino
acid levels for several hours after ingestion. they
reported that the whey protein condition displayed ro-
bust hyperaminoacidemia 100 min after administration.
however, by 300 min, amino acid concentrations had
returned to baseline. in contrast, the casein condition
resulted in a slow increase in amino acid concentrations,
which remained elevated above baseline after 300 min.
over the study duration, casein produced a greater
whole body leucine balance than the whey protein con-
dition, leading the researcher to suggest that prolonged,
moderate hyperaminoacidemia is more effective at
stimulating increases in whole body protein anabolism
than a robust, short lasting hyperaminoacidemia.
while this research appears to support the efficacy of
slower digesting proteins, subsequent work has ques-
tioned its validity in athletes. the first major criticism is
that boire and colleagues investigated whole body (non-
muscle and muscle) protein balance instead of skeletal
(myofibrillar) mps. this is important considering that
skeletal muscle protein turnover occurs at a much
slower rate than protein turnover of both plasma and
gut proteins; as a result, mps has been suggested tocontribute anywhere from 25 to 50% of total whole body
protein synthesis . these findings suggest that
changes in whole body protein turnover may poorly re-
flect the level of skeletal muscle protein metabolism that
may be taking place. trommelen and investigators 
examined 24 young men ingesting 30 g of casein protein
with or without completion of a single bout of resistance
exercise, and concluded that rates of mps were
increased, but whole-body protein synthesis rates were
not impacted.
more recently, tang and colleagues investigated
the effects of administering 22 g of hydrolyzed whey
isolate and micellar casein (10 g of eaas) at both rest
and following a single bout of resistance training in
young males. the area under the curve calculations
demonstrated a 200% greater increase in leucine concen-
trations in the blood following whey versus casein inges-
tion. moreover, these researchers reported that whey
protein ingestion stimulated greater mps at both rest
and following exercise when compared to casein. tipton
et al. used an acute study design involving a single
bout of lower body resistance exercise and 20-g doses of
casein or whey after completing the exercise session. in
comparison to the control group, both whey and casein
significantly increased leucine balance, but no differ-
ences were found between the two protein sources for
amino acid uptake and muscle protein balance.
additional research has also demonstrated that 10 weeks
of whey protein supplementation in trained bodybuilders
resulted in greater gains in lean mass (5.0 vs. 0.8 kg) and
strength compared to casein . these findings
suggest that the faster-digesting whey proteins may be
more beneficial for skeletal muscle adaptations than the
slower digesting casein.
effects of milk proteins on glycogen replenishment and
skeletal muscle damage
skeletal muscle glycogen stores are a critical element to
both prolonged and high-intensity exercise. in skeletal
muscle, glycogen synthase activity is considered one of
the key regulatory factors for glycogen synthesis.
research has demonstrated that the addition of protein
in the form of milk and whey protein isolate (0.4 g/kg)
to a moderate (0.8 g/kg), but not high (1.2 g/kg)
carbohydrate-containing (dextrose-maltodextrin) bever-
age promotes increased rates of muscle glycogen replen-
ishment following hard training . further, the
addition of protein facilitates repair and recovery of the
exercised muscle . these effects are thought to be
related to a greater insulin response following the exer-
cise bout. intriguingly, it has also been demonstrated
that whey protein enhances glycogen synthesis in the
liver and skeletal muscle more than casein in an insulin-
independent fashion that appears to be due to itsjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 13 of 25capacity to upregulate glycogen synthase activity .
therefore, the addition of milk protein to a post-
workout meal may augment recovery, improve protein
balance, and speed glycogen replenishment.
health benefits of milk-based proteins
while athletes tend to view whey as the ideal protein for
skeletal muscle repair and function it also has several
health benefits. in particular, whey protein contains an
array of biologically active peptides whose amino acids
sequences give them specific signaling effects when
liberated in the gut. not only is whey protein high in β-
lactoglobulin and α-lactalbumin (75% of total bovine
whey proteins), but it is also rich in eaas (approxi-
mately 50% by weight). furthermore, whey protein ap-
pears to play a role in enhancing lymphatic and immune
system responses . in addition, α-lactalbumin con-
tains an ample supply of tryptophan which increases
cognitive performance under stress , improves the
quality of sleep [172, 173], and may also speed wound
healing , properties which could be vital for recov-
ery from combat and contact sporting events. in
addition, lactoferrin is also found in both milk and in
whey protein, and has been demonstrated to have anti-
bacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties .
moreover, there is some evidence that whey protein can
bind iron and therefore increase its absorption and
retention .
egg proteins
egg protein is often thought of as an ideal protein
because its amino acid profile has been used as the
standard for comparing other dietary proteins .
due to their excellent digestibility and amino acid con-
tent, eggs are an excellent source of protein for athletes.
while the consumption of eggs has been criticized due
to their cholesterol content, a growing body of evidence
demonstrates the lack of a relationship between egg con-
sumption and coronary heart disease, making egg-based
products more appealing . one large egg has 75 kcal
and 6 g of protein, but only 1.5 g of saturated fat while
one large egg white has 16 kcal with 3.5 g of protein and
is fat-free. research using eggs as the protein source for
athletic performance and body composition is lacking,
perhaps due to less funding opportunities relative to
funding for dairy. egg protein may be particularly
important for athletes, as this protein source has been
demonstrated to significantly increase protein synthesis
of both skeletal muscle and plasma proteins after resist-
ance exercise at both 20 and 40 g doses. leucine oxida-
tion rates were found to increase following the 40 g
dose, suggesting that this amount exceeds an optimal
dose . in addition to providing a cost effective, high-
quality source of protein rich in leucine (0.5 g of leucineper serving), eggs have also been identified as a func-
tional food . functional foods are defined as foods
that, by the presence of physiologically active compo-
nents, provide a health benefit beyond basic nutrition
. according to the academy of nutrition and
dietetics, functional foods should be consumed as part
of a varied diet on a regular basis, at effective levels
. thus, it is essential that athletes select foods that
meet protein requirements and also optimize health and
prevent decrements in immune function following
intense training. important nutrients provided by eggs
include riboflavin (15% rda), selenium (17% rda) and
vitamin k (31% rda) . eggs are also rich in
choline, a nutrient which may have positive effects on
cognitive function . moreover, eggs provide an
excellent source of the carotenoid-based antioxidants
lutein and zeaxanthin . also, eggs can be prepared
with most meal choices, whether at breakfast, lunch, or
dinner. such positive properties increase the probability
of the athletes adhering to a diet rich in egg protein.
beef and other flesh proteins
meat proteins are a major staple in the american diet
and, depending on the cut of meat, contain varying
amounts of fat and cholesterol. meat proteins are well
known to be rich sources of the eaas . beef is a
common source of dietary protein and is considered to
be of high biological value because it contains the full
balance of eaas in a fraction similar to that found in
human skeletal muscle . a standard serving of
113.4 g lean beef provides 10 g of the eaas (3.5 g of
leucine) and 30 g of total amino acids. moreover, this
30 g dose of beef protein has been shown to stimulate
protein synthesis in both young and elderly subjects
. in addition to its rich content of amino acids, beef
and other flesh proteins can serve as important sources
of micronutrients such as iron, selenium, vitamins a,
b12 and folic acid. for the most part, these quality min-
erals and micronutrients cannot be as easily obtained
through plant-based proteins and/or the bioavailability
of these macronutrients from plants is limited. this is a
particularly important consideration for pregnant and
breastfeeding women. ultimately, as an essential part of
a mixed diet, meat helps to ensure adequate distribution
of essential micronutrients and amino acids to the body.
research has shown that significant differences in
skeletal muscle mass and body composition between
older men who resistance train and either consume
meat-based or lactoovovegetarian diet . over a 12-
week period, whole-body density, fat-free mass, and
whole-body muscle mass (as measured by urinary
creatinine excretion) increased in the meat-sourced diet
group but decreased in the lactoovovegetarian diet
group. these results indicate that not only do meat-jäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 14 of 25based diets increase fat-free mass, but also they may
specifically increase muscle mass, thus supporting the
many benefits of meat-based diets. a diet high in meat
protein in older adults may provide an important
resource in reducing the risk of sarcopenia.
positive results have also been seen in elite athletes
that consume meat-based proteins, as opposed to vege-
tarian diets . for example, carnitine is a molecule
that transports long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria
for oxidation and is found in high amounts in meat.
while evidence is lacking to support an increase in fat
oxidation with increased carnitine availability, carnitine
has been linked to the sparing of muscle glycogen, and
decreases in exercise-induced muscle damage .
certainly, more research is needed to support these
assertions. creatine is a naturally occurring compound
found mainly in muscle. the concentration of creatine
in uncooked chicken and beef is approximately
30 mmol/kg (4 –5 g/kg), meaning that one serving of
beef contains approximately 0.4 g of creatine .
vegetarians have lower total body creatine stores than
omnivores, which demonstrates that regular meat eating
has a significant effect on human creatine status .
moreover, creatine supplementation studies with vege-
tarians indicate that increased creatine uptake levels do
exist in people who practice various forms of vegetarian-
ism . sharp and investigators published the
only study known to compare different supplemental
(powdered) forms of animal proteins on adaptations to
resistance training such as increases in strength and im-
provements in body composition. forty-one men and
women performed a standardized resistance-training
program over eight weeks and consumed a daily 46 g
dose of either hydrolyzed chicken protein, beef protein
isolate, or whey protein concentrate in comparison to a
control group. all groups experienced similar increases
in upper and lower-body strength, but all protein-
supplemented groups reported significant increases in
lean mass and decreases in fat mass.
meat-based diets have been shown to include add-
itional overall health benefits. some studies have found
that meat, as a protein source, is associated with higher
serum levels of igf-1 , which in turn is related to
increased bone mineralization and fewer fractures .
meat vs. plant based proteins: is one better than the other?
a highly debated topic in nutrition and epidemiology is
whether vegetarian diets are a healthier choice than
omnivorous diets. one key difference is the fact that
vegetarian diets often lack equivalent amounts of protein
when compared to omnivorous diets . however,
with proper supplementation and careful nutritional
choices, it is possible to have complete proteins in a
vegetarian diet. generally by consuming high-quality,animal-based products (meat, milk, eggs, and cheese) an
individual will achieve optimal growth as compared to
ingesting only plant proteins . research has shown
that soy is considered a lower quality complete protein.
hartman et al. had participants consume a mixture
of sucrose and either 30 g of milk or soy proteins during
12-weeks of resistance training. they found that the
participants that consumed the milk protein increased
lean mass and decreased fat mass more than the control
and soy groups. moreover, the soy group was not signifi-
cantly different from the control group. similarly, a
study by tang and colleagues directly compared the
abilities of hydrolyzed whey isolate, soy isolate, and mi-
cellar casein to stimulate rates of mps both at rest and
in response to a single bout of lower body resistance
training. these authors reported that the ability of soy to
stimulate mps was greater than casein, but less than
whey, at rest and in response to an acute resistance
exercise stimulus. while soy is considered a complete
protein, it contains lower amounts of bcaas than
bovine milk . additionally, research has found that
dietary soy phytoestrogens inhibit mtor expression in
skeletal muscle through activation of ampk . thus,
not only does soy contain lower amounts of the eaas
and leucine, but soy protein may also be responsible for
inhibiting growth factors and protein synthesis via its
negative regulation of mtor. when considering the
multitude of plant sources of protein, soy overwhelm-
ingly has the most research. limited evidence using
wheat protein in older men has suggested that wheat
protein stimulates significantly lower levels of mps
when compared to an identical dose (35 g) of casein
protein, but when this dose is increased nearly two fold
(60 g) this protein source is able to significantly increase
rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis . rice protein
is a medium to slow absorbing protein, which is in line
with other non-meat/non-dairy proteins, however,
leucine from rice protein shows unique absorption kinet-
ics, peaking faster than leucine from whey protein .
as mentioned earlier, a study by joy and colleagues 
in which participants participated in resistance training
program for eight weeks while taking identical, high
doses of either rice or whey protein, demonstrated that
rice protein stimulated similar increases in body com-
position adaptations to whey protein.
protein blends
the majority of available science has explored the effi-
cacy of ingesting single protein sources, but evidence
continues to mount that combining protein sources may
afford additional benefits . for example, a 10-week
resistance training study by kerksick and colleagues 
demonstrated that a combination of whey (40 g) and
casein (8 g) yielded the greatest increase in fat-free massjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 15 of 25(determined by dexa) when compared to both a
combination of 40 g of whey, 5 g of glutamine, and 3 g
of bcaas and a placebo consisting of 48 g of a malto-
dextrin carbohydrate. later, kerksick et al. demon-
strated various combinations of whey, casein, and
colostrum proteins with and without creatine can also
yield positive improvements in strength and body com-
position over a 12-week resistance training and supple-
mentation regimen. similarly, hartman and investigators
 had 56 healthy young men train for 12 weeks while
either ingesting isocaloric and isonitrogenous doses of
fat-free milk (a blend of whey and casein), soy protein or
a carbohydrate placebo and concluded that fat-free milk
stimulated the greatest increases in type i and ii muscle
fiber area as well as fat-free mass; however, strength
outcomes were not affected. moreover, wilkinson and
colleagues demonstrated that ingestion of fat-free
milk (vs. soy or carbohydrate) led to a greater area under
the curve for net balance of protein and that the frac-
tional synthesis rate of muscle protein was greatest after
milk ingestion. in 2013, reidy et al. indicated that
a mixture of whey and soy protein over a four-hour
measurement window similarly increased mps rates
during the early (0 –2 h) time-period versus whey
protein, but only the protein blend was able to stimulate
significantly increased mps rates during the later (2 –
4 h) measurement window. however, when the entire
four-hour measurement period was considered, no
difference in mps rates were found. a follow-up publi-
cation from the same clinical trial also reported that
ingestion of the protein blend resulted in a positive and
prolonged amino acid balance when compared to inges-
tion of whey protein alone, while post-exercise rates of
myofibrillar protein synthesis were similar between the
two conditions . reidy et al. reported that in
68 healthy young men who were participating in a
supervised resistance-training program over 12 weeks,
there were increases in whole body lean mass with either
whey protein or a whey protein and soy protein blend
compared to a maltodextrin placebo. no differences
were found between whey and the whey and soy blend.
criteria for comparing protein sources
some valid criteria exist to compare protein sources and
provide an objective method of how to include them in
a diet. as previously mentioned, common means of
assessing protein quality include biological value,
protein efficiency ratio, pdcaas and iaao. the deriv-
ation of each technique is different with all having
distinct advantages and disadvantages. for nearly all
populations, ideal methods should be linked to the
capacity of the protein to positively affect protein
balance in the short term, and facilitate increases and
decreases in lean and fat-mass, respectively, over thelong term. in addition, the protein ’s ability to enhance
immune function and promote an anti-oxidative envir-
onment should also be considered. to this point, dairy,
egg, meat, and plant-based proteins have been discussed.
two critical variables exist that determine a protein ’s
impact on overall protein accretion and protein turn-
over: a) the protein ’s leucine content and b) the rate at
which the protein is digested. in general, the proteins
with the greatest leucine content include dairy (9 –11%),
egg (8.6%), and meat (8%), while sources low in leucine
include plant-based proteins. faster digesting sources of
protein include whey and egg whites, soy, and very lean
cuts of meat (>95% lean). in contrast, casein and fatty
cuts of meat (<80% lean) act as slowly digested sources
of protein. as mentioned previously, initial research by
boirie and dangin has highlighted the impact of protein
digestion rate on net protein balance with the two milk
proteins: whey and casein [165 –167]. subsequent
follow-up work has used this premise as a reference
point for the digestion rates of other protein sources.
using the criteria of leucine content, norton and
wilson et al. [198, 199] used animal models to compare
the potential to activate initiation factors and mps
between four different protein sources: wheat (supple-
mented with leucine), soy, egg, and whey, (containing
6.8, 8.0, 8.8, and 11% leucine, respectively) using a diet
consisting of three meals per day. macronutrient intake
was 16/54/30% for protein, carbohydrates and fat, re-
spectively. wheat and soy did not stimulate mps above
fasted levels, whereas egg and whey proteins significantly
increased mps rates, with mps for whey protein being
greater than egg protein. mps responses were closely re-
lated to changes in plasma leucine and phosphorylation
of 4e –bp1 and s6 k protein signaling molecules. more
importantly, following 2- and 11-weeks of ingestion, it
was demonstrated that the leucine content of the meals
increased muscle mass and was inversely correlated with
body fat.
tang et al. compared high leucine/fast-digesting
(hydrolyzed whey isolate), lower leucine/intermediate
digesting (soy isolate) and high leucine/slow-digesting
(micellar casein) protein sources on mps at rest and
following exercise. the researchers demonstrated that
mps at rest was higher after ingestion of faster digesting
proteins compared to slower digesting proteins (whey
and soy > casein). specifically, mps after consumption
of whey was approximately 93% and 18% greater than
casein and soy, respectively. a similar pattern of results
was observed after resistance exercise (whey > soy > ca-
sein) whereby protein synthesis following whey con-
sumption was approximately 122% and 31% greater than
casein and soy, respectively. mps was also greater after
soy consumption at rest (64%) and following resistance
exercise (69%) compared with casein. these findingsjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 16 of 25lead us to conclude that athletes should seek protein
sources that are both fast-digesting and high in leucine
content to maximally stimulate rates of mps at rest and
following training. moreover, in consideration of the
various additional attributes that high-quality protein
sources deliver, it may be advantageous to consume a
combination of higher quality protein sources (dairy,
egg, and meat sources).
key points
/c15multiple protein sources are available for an athlete
to consider, and each has their own advantages and
disadvantages.
/c15protein sources are commonly evaluated based upon
the content of amino acids, particularly the eaas,
they provide. beyond amino acid content, the fat,
calorie, and micronutrient content, and presence of
various bioactive peptides all contribute to a
protein ’s quality.
/c15leucine content and rate of digestion have also been
demonstrated in multiple scientific studies to play an
important role in an athlete ’s ability to train,
compete, and recover.
/c15blends of protein sources might afford a favorable
combination of key nutrients such as leucine, eaas,
bioactive peptides, and antioxidants, but more
research is needed to determine their ideal
composition.
preparation methods of various proteins
nutrient density is defined as the amount of a particular
nutrient (carbohydrate, protein, fat, etc.) per unit of en-
ergy in a given food. in many situations, the commercial
preparation method of foods can affect the actual nutri-
ent density of the resulting food. using protein as an
example, full-fat milk is approximately 150 cal a serving,
and of this 8 g, or about 21% is from protein. skim milk
on the other hand contains approximately 9 g of protein
in a 90-cal eight-ounce serving, making it approximately
40% protein. when producing milk protein supplements,
special preparations must be made to separate the
protein sources from the lactose and fat calories in milk.
for example, the addition of acid to milk causes the
casein to coagulate or collect at the bottom, while the
whey is left on the top . these proteins are then
filtered to increase their purity. a concentrate is com-
monly defined as any protein product that is 29 –80%
protein by dry weight. sport nutrition products gener-
ally use concentrates that are 70 –80% protein .
as extra filtering steps are added, the purity of the
final product increases and when a final protein prod-
uct yields greater than 90% protein, it is considered
an isolated protein .filtration processes
filtration methods differ, and there are both benefits and
disadvantages to each. the two most popular methods
of filtration of a given protein are the use of ion ex-
change and micro/ultrafiltration methods. ion exchange
exposes a given protein source, such as whey, to hydro-
chloric acid and sodium hydroxide, thereby producing
an electric charge on the proteins that can be used to
separate them from lactose and fat . the advantage
of this method is that it is relatively cheap and produces
the highest protein concentration . the disadvantage
is that ion exchange filtration typically denatures some of
the valuable immune-boosting, anti-carcinogenic peptides
found in whey . cross-flow microfiltration, and ultra-
micro filtration are based on the premise that the molecu-
lar weight of whey protein is greater than lactose, and use
1 and 0.25- μm ceramic membranes, respectively, to separ-
ate the two. as a result, whey protein is trapped in the
membranes but the lactose and other components pass
through. the advantage is that these processes do not de-
nature valuable proteins and peptides found in whey, so
the protein itself is deemed to be of higher quality .
the main disadvantage is that this filtration process is
typically costlier than the ion exchange method.
hydrolyzed proteins
when consumed whole, proteins are digested through a
series of steps beginning with homogenization by chew-
ing, followed by partial digestion by pepsin in the stom-
ach . following this, a combination of peptides,
proteins, and negligible amounts of single amino acids
are released into the small intestine and from there are
either partially hydrolyzed into oligopeptides, 2 –8 amino
acids in length or are fully hydrolyzed into individual
amino acids . absorption of individual amino acids
and various small peptides (di, tri, and tetra) into the
blood occurs inside the small intestine through separate
transport mechanisms . oftentimes, products con-
tain proteins that have been pre-exposed to specific
digestive enzymes causing hydrolysis of the proteins into
di, tri, and tetrapeptides. a plethora of studies have
investigated the effects of the degree of protein fraction-
ation (or degree of hydrolysis) on the absorption of
amino acids and the subsequent hormonal response
[202 –207]. research indicates that amino acids are
absorbed more rapidly when they are consumed as di
and/or tri peptides compared to free form amino acids
or complete proteins . further, the rate of absorp-
tion may lead to a more favorable anabolic hormonal en-
vironment [202, 203, 206]. calbet et al. examined
both amino acid appearance and insulin responses
following consumption of protein solutions containing
the same amount of protein, or pure carbohydrates. the
treatments consisted of a pure glucose solution, wheyjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 17 of 25peptide hydrolysates, and cow ’s milk containing milk
proteins, lactose and fat. each of the nitrogen containing
solutions contained 15 g of glucose and 30 g of protein.
results indicated that peptide hydrolysates produced a
faster increase in venous plasma amino acids compared
to milk proteins. further, the peptide hydrolysates
produced peak plasma insulin levels that were two- and
four-times greater than that evoked by the milk and
glucose solutions, respectively, with a correlation of 0.8
between plasma amino acids and the insulin response in
the peptide hydrolysates. one of the inherent shortcom-
ings of this study is that milk proteins are 80% casein
and, therefore, are not ideal candidates to compare with
hydrolyzed whey.
in a more appropriate comparison, morifuji et al.
 investigated the effects of 12.5 g of either hydro-
lyzed or non-hydrolyzed soy and whey proteins on
changes in plasma levels of the eaas, bcaas, and insu-
lin. results indicated that protein hydrolysates produced
greater responses than their non-hydrolyzed counterpart
in plasma for each of the variables (hydrolyzed whey >
non-hydrolyzed whey > hydrolyzed soy > non-
hydrolyzed soy). however, calbet et al. found that
36 g of hydrolyzed or non-hydrolyzed whey and casein
led to no differences in the plasma amino acid/bcaa
responses in the whey groups. the hydrolyzed casein,
however, did result in a greater amino acid response
than the nonhydrolyzed casein. finally, both hydrolyzed
groups resulted in greater gastric secretions, as well as
greater plasma increases, in glucose-dependent insulino-
tropic polypeptides .
buckley and colleagues found that a ~ 30 g dose
of a hydrolyzed whey protein isolate resulted in a more
rapid recovery of muscle force-generating capacity
following eccentric exercise, compared with a flavored
water placebo or a non-hydrolyzed form of the same
whey protein isolate. indeed, the effect of this hydrolys-
ate was such that complete recovery of muscle force-
generating capacity had been achieved by six hours post
supplementation, while the normal whey and placebo
groups ’strength remained depressed 24 h later. in agree-
ment with these findings, cooke et al. had 17
untrained men complete an eccentric-based resistance
training bout to invoke muscle damage and supple-
mented with either carbohydrate or a hydrolyzed whey
protein isolate. three and seven days after completing
the damaging exercise bout, maximal strength levels
were higher in the hydrolyzed whey protein group com-
pared to carbohydrate supplementation. additionally,
blood concentrations of muscle damage markers tended
to be lower when four ~30-g doses of a hydrolyzed whey
protein isolate were ingested for two weeks following
the damaging bout. beyond influencing strength recov-
ery after damaging exercise, other benefits of hydrolyzedproteins have been suggested. for example, morifuji et
al. using an animal model reported that the ability
of whey hydrolysates to increase skeletal muscle glyco-
gen replenishment after exercise was greater when com-
pared to bcaa ingestion. furthermore, lockwood et al.
 investigated the effects of ingesting either 30 g of
hydrolyzed whey or two varying forms of whey protein
concentrates during a linear resistance-training protocol
over 8 weeks. results indicated that strength and lean
body mass (lbm) increased equally in all groups. how-
ever, fat mass decreased only in the hydrolyzed whey
protein group. while more work needs to be completed
to fully determine the potential impact of hydrolyzed
proteins on strength and body composition changes, this
initial study suggests that hydrolyzed whey may be effi-
cacious for decreasing body fat. finally, saunders et al.
 had thirteen trained male cyclists complete a simu-
lated 60-km time trial where they ingested either carbo-
hydrate or carbohydrate and protein hydrolysate at equal
intervals throughout the race as well as at the conclu-
sion of the race. the authors reported that co-ingestion
of a carbohydrate and protein hydrolysate improved
time-trial performance late in the exercise protocol and
significantly reduced soreness and markers of muscle
damage. two excellent reviews on the topic of hydro-
lyzed proteins and their impact on performance and re-
covery have been published by van loon et al. and
saunders .
digestive enzymes in proteins
digestion is the physiological process of rendering the
food we eat into smaller components that allow key
nutrients to be assimilated into our body ’s tissues. the
prevalence of digestive enzymes in sports nutrition
products has increased during recent years with many
products now containing a combination of proteases
and lipases, with the addition of carbohydrates in plant
proteins. proteases can hydrolyze proteins into various
peptide configurations and potentially single amino
acids. it appears that digestive enzyme capabilities and
production decrease with age , thus increasing the
difficulty with which the body can break down and
digest large meals. digestive enzymes could potentially
work to promote optimal digestion by allowing up-
regulation of various metabolic enzymes that may be
needed to allow for efficient bodily operation. further,
digestive enzymes have been shown to minimize quality
differences between varying protein sources .
individuals looking to increase plasma peak amino acid
concentrations may benefit from hydrolyzed protein
sources or protein supplemented with digestive enzymes.
however, more work is needed before definitive
conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of
digestive enzymes.jäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 18 of 25protein safety
despite a plethora of studies demonstrating safety, much
concern still exists surrounding the clinical implications
of consuming increased amounts of protein, particularly
on renal and hepatic health. the majority of these con-
cerns stem from renal failure patients and educational
dogma that has not been rewritten as evidence mounts
to the contrary. certainly, it is clear that people in renal
failure benefit from protein-restricted diets , but
extending this pathophysiology to otherwise healthy
exercise-trained individuals who are not clinically
compromised is inappropriate. published reviews on this
topic consistently report that an increased intake of
protein by competitive athletes and active individuals
provides no indication of hepato-renal harm or damage
[216, 217]. this is supported by a recent commentary
 which referenced recent reports from the world
health organization where they indicated a lack of
evidence linking a high protein diet to renal disease.
likewise, the panel charged with establishing reference
nutrient values for australia and new zealand also
stated there was no published evidence that elevated in-
takes of protein exerted any negative impact on kidney
function in athletes or in general .
recently, antonio and colleagues published a series of
original investigations that prescribed extremely high
amounts of protein (~3.4 –4.4 g/kg/day) and have
consistently reported no harmful effects [220 –223]. the
first study in 2014 had resistance-trained individuals
consume an extremely high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/day)
for eight weeks and reported no change in adverse out-
comes . a follow-up investigation required
participants to ingest up to 3.4 g/kg/day of protein for
eight weeks while following a prescribed resistance train-
ing program and reported no changes in any of the
blood parameters commonly used to assess clinical
health (e.g., there was no effect on kidney or liver func-
tion). their next study employed a crossover study
design in twelve healthy resistance-trained men in which
each participant was tested before and after for body
composition as well as blood-markers of health and per-
formance . in one eight-week block, participants
followed their normal (habitual) diet (2.6 g/kg/day) and
in the other eight-week block, participants were pre-
scribed to ingest greater than 3.0 g/kg/day resulting in
an average protein intake of 2.9 g/kg/day over the entire
16-week study. no changes in body composition were
reported, and importantly, no clinical side effects were
observed throughout the study. finally, the same group
of authors published a one-year crossover study in
fourteen healthy resistance-trained men. when pre-
scribed to a high protein diet, the participants were
instructed to ingest 3 g/kg/day and achieved an average
intake of 3.3 g/kg/day and when following their normaldiet they consumed 2.5 g/kg/day. this investigation
showed that the chronic consumption of a high protein
diet (i.e., for 1 year) had no harmful effects on kidney or
liver function. furthermore, there were no alterations in
clinical markers of metabolism and blood lipids.
key points
/c15multiple review articles indicate that no controlled
scientific evidence exists indicating that increased
intakes of protein pose any health risks in healthy,
exercising individuals.
/c15statements by large regulatory bodies have also
indicated that concerns about one ’s health
secondary to ingesting high amounts of protein
are unfounded.
/c15a series of controlled investigations spanning up to
one year in duration utilizing protein intakes of up
to 2.5 –3.3 g/kg/day in healthy resistance-trained
individuals consistently indicate that increased
intakes of protein exert no harmful effect on blood
lipids or markers of kidney and liver function.
conclusion
in alignment with our previous position stand, it is the
position of the international society of sports nutrition
that the majority of exercising individuals should
consume at minimum approximately 1.4 to 2.0 g of pro-
tein per kg of bodyweight per day to optimize exercise
training induced adaptations. importantly, this recom-
mendation also falls within the institute of medicine ’s
acceptable macronutrient distribution range (amdr)
of 10 –35% protein . the amount is dependent
upon the mode and intensity of the exercise, the quality
of the protein ingested, as well as the energy and carbo-
hydrate status of the individual. however, it should be
noted that there is preliminary evidence that consuming
much higher quantities of protein (> 3 g/kg/d) may con-
fer a benefit as it relates to body composition. concerns
that protein intake within this range is unhealthy are un-
founded in healthy, exercising individuals. an attempt
should be made to consume whole foods that contain
high-quality (e.g., complete) sources of protein; however,
supplemental protein is a safe and convenient method of
ingesting high-quality dietary protein. the timing of
protein intake in the period encompassing the exercise
session may offer several benefits including improved re-
covery and greater gains in lean body mass. however,
perhaps the most important issue regarding protein
intake during the peri-workout period is that it serves as
an opportunity to eat thus elevating one ’s total daily
protein intake. in addition, consuming protein pre-sleep
has been shown to increase overnight mps and next-
morning metabolism acutely along with improvementsjäger et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2017) 14:20 page 19 of 25in muscle size and strength over 12 weeks of resistance
training. intact protein supplements, eaas and leucine
have been shown to be beneficial for the exercising indi-
vidual by increasing the rates of mps, decreasing muscle
protein degradation, and possibly aiding in recovery
from exercise. in summary, increasing protein intake
using whole foods as well as high-quality supplemental
protein sources can improve the adaptive response to
training.

abstract: competitive bodybuilders undergo strict dietary and training practices to achieve an
extremely lean and muscular physique. the purpose of this study was to identify and describe
different dietary strategies used by bodybuilders, their rationale, and the sources of information from
which these strategies are gathered. in-depth interviews were conducted with seven experienced
(10.43.4 years bodybuilding experience), male, natural bodybuilders. participants were asked about
training, dietary and supplement practices, and information resources for bodybuilding strategies.
interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. during the
off-season, energy intake was higher and less restricted than during the in-season to aid in muscle
hypertrophy. there was a focus on high protein intake with adequate carbohydrate to permit high
training loads. to create an energy deficit and loss of fat mass, energy intake was gradually and
progressively reduced during the in-season via a reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake. the rationale
for weekly higher carbohydrate refeed days was to offset declines in metabolic rate and fatigue, while
in the final “peak week” before competition, the reasoning for fluid and sodium manipulation and
carbohydrate loading was to enhance the appearance of leanness and vascularity. other bodybuilders,
coaches and the internet were significant sources of information. despite the common perception of
extreme, non-evidence-based regimens, these bodybuilders reported predominantly using strategies
which are recognized as evidence-based, developed over many years of experience. additionally,
novel strategies such as weekly refeed days to enhance fat loss, and sodium and fluid manipulation,
warrant further investigation to evaluate their efficacy and safety.

1. introduction
competitive bodybuilders undergo strict dietary and training practices to achieve an extremely
lean, muscular and symmetrical physique [ 1]. along with resistance and aerobic exercise [ 2], targeted
energy and macronutrient intakes are followed to accumulate muscle mass in the off-season, and
reduce fat mass in the in-season [ 1]. however the specific dietary strategies employed by bodybuilders
and their underpinning rationale remain poorly understood.
contemporary literature examining the dietary intakes of bodybuilders is limited [ 1], and given
the unique nature of competitive bodybuilding, it may be inappropriate to draw dietary parallels
from other sports. although bodybuilders have been reported to follow extreme, non-evidence-based
approaches, several dietary strategies developed in bodybuilding have recently been scientifically
validated, such as frequent dosing of protein [ 3], and intake of protein around training [ 4]. identifying
sports 2017 ,5, 76; doi:10.3390/sports5040076 www.mdpi.com/journal/sportssports 2017 ,5, 76 2 of 13
the dietary strategies of modern bodybuilders, and exploring their underpinning rationale, will provide
exercise, sport and nutrition practitioners with an understanding of current bodybuilding methods
and insights to assist with negotiating practical and effective ways to work towards bodybuilding
goals. furthermore, identifying such strategies will also generate hypotheses for future research.
in-depth interviews allow a deep exploration of the discussed topic, enable the researchers to
enter new areas and produce rich data, with an additional benefit of uncovering practices that had
not been anticipated [ 5,6]. the purpose of this study was to use in-depth interviews to identify and
describe different dietary strategies used by male, natural bodybuilders, their rationale, and the sources
of education from which these strategies are gathered.
2. materials and methods
participants were purposively selected by the research team based on expertise and experience in
competitive bodybuilding. to recruit participants, experienced bodybuilders known to the researchers
from previous studies were invited to participate. adverts were placed on the website and social
media page of australasian natural bodybuilding (anb), and distributed at the anb national titles
in october 2015. to be included, participants needed to be male, natural (drug-free) bodybuilders,
aged 18 years and older, with five or more years of bodybuilding experience. participants were
required to have competed in the bodybuilding category at national or international level contests of
drug-tested federations.
2.1. procedures
the interviews were conducted by three members of the research team between march 2015 and
february 2016. interviews (78–124 min) were held by telephone or skype. the combined duration of all
interviews was 11 h. interviews captured participant demographic characteristics including age, years
of bodybuilding experience, number of previous competitions, and competition success. participants
were asked about their training, dietary, supplement and competition preparation practices, the
rationale behind these practices, and where they obtained information about nutrition and training.
by the end of the last interview, no new major themes were emerging. saturation was confirmed
following coding of the data, therefore the decision was made to cease further data collection.
2.2. analysis
all interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed by a commercial transcription service
(waywithwords.com). transcripts were returned to participants for verification and correction to
ensure the transcription correctly reflected the content of their interview. one participant returned
the transcript with minor emendations, which was included in the analysis. notes were taken during
all interviews and used to clarify transcription errors, and to confirm the meaning of spoken phrases
during the coding process. to protect the identity of the participants, a pseudonym was used in the final
transcripts. all interviews were conducted prior to thematic analysis via qualitative content analysis
using qualitative data analysis software (nvivo version 10.0, qsr international pty ltd., doncaster,
australia, 2012). coding was undertaken by one researcher (lm) with assistance from a second (fe)
and overseen by a third researcher experienced in qualitative research (jg), who reviewed any queries.
as coding of data proceeded, underlying themes emerged as participants discussed topics introduced
by the interviewers, and was not constrained by the original structure of the interview. identification
of themes recurring through and across interviews was achieved through a process of reading, coding,
code category refinement, rereading and code checking, and analysis of developing concepts. a coding
journal with an audit trail of changes in coding and code refinement was maintained by the primary
coder (lm) to maintain transparency of the qualitative analysis process.
counts of coded talk were available from the analysis software by grouping for diet, training,
supplements, and information and education. counts within themes could have more than one section
of speech by the same participant. to avoid researcher bias during the data interpretation processsports 2017 ,5, 76 3 of 13
based on preconceived ideas of bodybuilding practices, identified themes were sent to participants,
who confirmed correct interpretation.
ethical approval was received from the university of sydney human ethics committee. written
informed consent was provided by all participants. participation was voluntary and identity of
participants and confidentiality of their responses was ensured.

when i have my carbs around my training time, so pre-, intra- and post-workout is when i consume the majority of my carbohydrates
through the day,” (luke) “i will actually introduce more carbohydrate for fuel, you know, to fuel the requirement to get through, say,
a 35-min interval session,” (oliver)
protein 7“i normally keep protein static. i’ll set it slightly higher than the off-season at the start of my prep and then just keep it the same
throughout even if i lose weight. so if you were to look at it from a gram per kilogram basis, it would look like it’s going up, but it’s
the same gram amount. so i’ll start at 225 g protein and just keep that throughout, so that will be roughly like 2.3,
2.4 g per kg,” (harry)
fat 7“i think i start with my fat probably around 25% [of energy] and then it might get as low as 15% to 20% at the end . . .so a day at the
very end might be 40 g of fat.” (harry) “so for example, i might start [the in-season] with my fat around 65 g [per day] and then that
will only get decreased by maximum of 25 g while the carbohydrates can drop from, you know, 250 [g] at the start or 275 [g] all the
way down to 100 [g] at the end on my low days,” (harry)
energy 15“so i probably start on average about 2400–2500 calories [per day] across the seven days, and i probably finish around 2000 or 1900
[per day] with probably a twofold increase in cardio.” (harry)
refeed days refeed days 32“i have one day that’s closer to my, like my off-season calories. so that might be like 2800 calories on a day predominantly increasing
carbohydrate. that’s to kind of stimulate further losses to prevent some of the downgrades in my energy expenditure you could say,
and to replenish glycogen, to feel mentally refreshed, to get a break in.” (harry)sports 2017 ,5, 76 5 of 13

loading39“so normally, i will increase my carbohydrates early in the week, sometime around tuesday or wednesday for saturday show, taper
them back down but not all the way down where they were at the lowest low. so maybe 400 [g] for a day and then down to say
350 [g/d], 300 [g/d], 250 [g/d], and then on friday and saturday, the show, i will be closer to 300 or the 400 [g/d] range to kind of fill
back out. so it’s basically kind of like a modified carb loading strategy an endurance athlete would use.” (harry) “the idea is to, you
know, wring out the sponge, i suppose, of the last stage of leaning out in those depletion days, and they would be paired with high
volume gym work, and the theory behind it was, apparently, to swell the muscle belly, it’s not a vascular thing, it was actually just
increased overall fullness of the muscle once you flooded it with carbohydrate.” (oliver) “he felt i looked my best, you know, 24 h
prior to the competition, so all these little things you’ve sort of got to take note of and you think, all right, i look this good now, it’ll be
even better tomorrow, and in my case it wasn’t, and you think, well, maybe we just do a carb load of two days next time around
instead of three, if that works perfectly for that timeframe.” (oliver)
water loading 17“so then the water is still going in around about ten litres a day . . . then the water would start to, the water would start to cut back
again as well and that was, sort of, you know, thursday might still be up around about the ten litres, but then friday and saturday,
friday might cut down to around about four litres and then saturday was two litres prior to, sort of, two o’clock or something like
that . . .and then, you know, nothing, yes.” (luke) “muscle is 70% water and i’m not aware of any mechanism that tells the body to
go after subcutaneous water. if you’re going to dehydrate, it’s going to be from everywhere and why are you pulling 70, you know,
why are you pulling so much volume out of your muscles because you’re really wanting your muscles to be volumised?” (will)
“those things don’t work for me,” (ben) “a terrible, terrible thing to put your body through,” (luke)
sodium
manipulation12“so on the monday, tuesday, wednesday would be salt in each meal, with probably around about two grams of salt, a gram, yes, one
or two grams of salt with each meal, which was great, but then by wednesday, oh man, you’ve just had this salty fishy chicken meal,
it’s just absolutely disgusting and terrible. and then on the thursday, friday, saturday, the salt would be dropped out.” (luke) “it’s
such a variable which can be really, really . . . completely screw you up . . . like, if you diet for 16 weeks and then the last two days
you mess around with your sodium, and then you come on the stage bloated, it’s such a . . . it’s such a bummer.” (kyle)
post-competition post-competition 15“you kind of work yourself up into a frenzy,” (ben) “it’s not so much hunger, it’s more so flavour. it’s more sort of like i want a pizza
because i haven’t had it in months,” (kyle) “we eat everything we haven’t eaten all year,” (will)
supplementsprotein
powders23“i take, obviously, protein powders. i take wpi [whey protein isolate] just because it’s, you know, it’s fast to absorb, or whatever . . .
and then obviously, yes, and then obviously casein at night.” (kyle)
creatine 15“i don’t think i’ve stopped taking creatine monohydrate since 2004 to be honest.” (harry) “the only thing i ever saw a result from
was creatine. my wife would always say, ‘you’ve started using that creatine again, haven’t you?’ i’d say, ‘why?’ she’d say,
‘oh, you’ve got that swollen look about you, you know, that volumized look.’” (will)
glutamine 10“glutamine is ten grams post-training in the off-season. once i’m in diet mode for comp, especially the last four or five weeks, i up
that to around about 40 g a day.” (luke) “it’s supposed to help with your immune system and anticatabolic, so being on a lower
calorie diet, i’m trying to stop muscle catabolism and glutamine is supposed to help out. and the last three times that i’ve dieted, i’ve,
before that, the last four weeks i used to always get sick, always catch a cold or something. the last three times i’ve dieted, i’ve upped,
had 40 g of glutamine a day for the last four or five weeks and i haven’t gotten sick.” (luke)
preworkouts 9“and it worked really well. it was, i was really focused in the gym . . . i just wanted to keep on training. i was just thinking about
training, thinking about what i was doing at that time and was getting really into, into that workout.” (luke) “i’m quite sensitive to
caffeine by itself and i’ve had some of those preworkouts and not gotten to sleep until one or two o’clock in the morning and that’s
having had it at 4:30 in the afternoon, five o’clock in the afternoon. so i’ve actually stayed away from those because of that.” (luke)sports 2017 ,5, 76 6 of 13

have an idea, like, should i do this maybe with my, you know, carbs, or whatever, i’ll run it by him first and he’ll give the okay or he’ll

everyone’s first port of call,” (kyle) “the internet is littered with online gurus,” (oliver) “it then just comes back to social media, and
it’s the problem what i call the good-looking trainer. so the most popular ones with the most likes, whatever, let’s face it, they’re the

great, so whatever they’re about to tell you must be good, rather than some rough-headed coach who’s in his 60s who’s done this sort
of stuff all his life,” (oliver) “he’s 17 years old and he’s following all these guys on instagram and facebook and things like that, and i

3.1. diet
3.1.1. off-season
all participants consumed four to six meals per day, with a targeted energy and macronutrient
intake aimed to support muscular hypertrophy, “i’ve got 250 [g/day] protein, and at the moment i’ll
divvy my fats and carbs up, so 250 [g] protein, 680 [g] carb and about 100, 110 [g] on fats, somewhere
there,” (keith). each meal featured a large serving of a high protein food and a large serving of
vegetables, “in the morning i start off with 100 g of oats and six whole eggs. that’s at around about
7:00 a.m. at 9:30 a.m. will be 200 g of salmon and 200 g of green veg,” (luke). the off-season
diet contained a wide variety of foods, including processed foods such as ice cream, and was less
regimented than the in-season.
3.1.2. in-season
while the pattern and style of the diet was similar to the off-season, the in-season intake was
more structured, “it’s more structured, it’s perfect” (kyle), and usually carefully measured, “i will split
a grain of rice, if it made it hit exactly the grammage (sic) i want,” (keith). serving sizes were also
reduced as competition approached.
progressive reductions in carbohydrate and fat intake were used to create then maintain an energy
deficit to elicit fat loss (figure 1). protein intake remained similar to the off-season to prevent loss of
lean mass. carbohydrate intake was carefully timed around exercise (pre-, during and post-training)
to ensure training was optimized.

3.1.4. peak week
the week prior to the contest was defined as a “peak week”, where particular short-term strategies
were used to achieve the leanest possible appearance. six participants used a modified carbohydrate
loading regimen (tapered training and increased carbohydrate intake) [ 7] in order to increase glycogen
and theoretically increase muscle volume. four participants had previously used the classic loading
method, which involved a three-day glycogen depletion and then super-compensation [ 8], however
found this did not produce significant changes in appearance, describing this method as, “stressful,”
(ben) “mentally that would be really bad,” (kyle) and, “you’re just a wreck” (luke).
all seven participants discussed the practice of water loading and cutting during peak week.
users of this strategy consumed more than 10 l of water per day early in the week, then reduced water
intake each day leading into the contest. the rationale for this strategy was to increase fluid excretion
and to “go after subcutaneous water” (will), which would purportedly provide a leaner, more vascular
appearance. results were not effective enough for these participants to warrant continuation of this
strategy in subsequent competition preparations. other participants commented that the idea of water
loading and cutting does not make sense physiologically: “muscle is about 70% water. if you were
dehydrated, the muscles are going to look smaller as well,” (harry).
sodium manipulation was another strategy used during the peak week to reduce body water and
produce a leaner appearance. three participants discussed previously using this strategy, whereby
sodium intake was greatly increased for three days, followed by a complete restriction of salt for three
days. however, they each reported that the results were inconsistent, and discontinued the strategy.
3.1.5. competition day
six participants discussed diet strategies used on the day of competition. two consumed sodium
prior to posing on stage to get a greater “pump”. small doses of high glycemic index carbohydrates
were consumed by two participants. one justified this by saying, “that was just to keep you ticking,
when you’re feeling that depleted, just to keep you propped up,” (oliver) while the other participant
commented, “that’s for sugars, to get the pump” (kyle). two participants did not change from their
usual intake on competition day.
3.1.6. post-competition
participants reported the post-competition diet was more relaxed ( n= 5), and included some
“treat” foods not consumed during the in-season. overindulgence and the experience of feeling
physically sick from the change in diet pattern ( n= 2) was reported. weight regain was common and
could be substantial (8–10 kg over three weeks in one case). limited time off dieting was reported by
three participants to avoid detrimental physique changes. participants reported negative changes in
physique were common post-competition.
3.2. supplements
all participants used one or more dietary supplements. in total, 18 different supplement types
were mentioned. creatine (3–15 g/d) was used by all participants with doses consumed either
pre- or post-workout, with a meal, or a combination of these. protein powders were also used by
all participants either as a post-training supplement ( n= 4) or as a source of protein during meals
(n= 4). “preworkout” supplements designed to stimulate enhanced training was discussed by four
participants, one of which used these for their caffeine content, while the others discontinued use due
to side effects (insomnia, increased and variable heart rate, and increased respiratory rate). participants
reported these experiences were: “absolutely horrible” (ben), “i just can’t stand it, frankly,” (will) and
“it’s counterproductive, so i don’t use it” (will). other supplements more commonly used were fish oil
(four participants), glutamine (three participants) and testosterone boosters (three participants).sports 2017 ,5, 76 9 of 13
3.3. sources of education
the most commonly reported sources of education were the internet, including bodybuilding,
strength and conditioning websites and forums ( n= 5), successful bodybuilders ( n= 4), and
bodybuilding coaches ( n= 4). the quality of information available on the internet was considered
to be both reputable and non-reputable. concerns were raised by two participants regarding
information on social media, where images and information may be unrealistic and deceptive, and
potentially damaging for novices. bodybuilding coaches were also commonly used, although one
participant commented on the varying levels of coach knowledge, with many relying on their own
competition experience.
4. discussion
the rationale and use of several key dietary strategies emerged from this study, including
regular doses of protein throughout the day to maximize accrual and maintenance of lean mass,
and utilizing carbohydrate foods as a fuel source pre-, during and post-exercise. weekly refeed days
were implemented during the in-season, to provide both a psychological rest and reportedly assist
with fat loss. during the peak week, bodybuilders followed extreme strategies including water and
sodium manipulation in an attempt to achieve the leanest physique.
throughout both the off-season and in-season, participants reported consuming large, frequent
servings of protein to build and maintain muscle mass, which is empirically supported in the research
literature [ 3]. the optimal dose to achieve this maximal muscle protein synthesis is accepted to be
20–30 g of high quality protein [ 3,9], with studies supporting that protein ingestion above this dose
is oxidized [ 9]. recent findings suggest the amount of muscle mass trained may be a determinant of
protein requirements post-exercise. greater myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate was achieved with a
40 versus 20 g dose of whey protein following whole-body resistance exercise [ 10]. therefore, a dose
up to 40 g may produce increased protein synthesis following resistance exercise incorporating large
amounts of muscle, such as those followed by bodybuilders.
the high-protein meals consumed by participants in this study likely exceeded the 20–40 g dose
for maximal protein synthesis, potentially resulting in increased protein oxidation. however, the
anabolic response to protein ingestion is a combination of protein synthesis and breakdown [ 11].
greater protein net balance has been produced from a 70 g versus 40 g dose of protein, primarily by
decreasing the rate of protein breakdown [ 11]. therefore, the frequent, higher-dosed protein meals
consumed by bodybuilders may not only assist in supporting protein synthesis, but also in reducing
protein degradation during heavy resistance training. furthermore, protein consumed by participants
was primarily a part of a mixed nutrient meal, rather than a pure protein meal typically prescribed
in the laboratory setting [ 3,9,10]. carbohydrate and fat consumed in these meals would slow the
digestive process, and amino acid delivery to muscle cells. any protein consumed in addition to the
optimal 20–40 g dose for muscle protein synthesis in these mixed meals may be utilized for anabolic
processes over the time course of digestion.
a protein intake of 2.3–3.1 g/kg of fat-free mass has been suggested to be the most protective
against losses of lean tissue during energy restriction in lean resistance trained athletes [ 12]. a higher
protein requirement may be justified for bodybuilders during competition preparation, as they perform
resistance and cardiovascular training, reduce energy intake, and achieve a lean condition [ 13].
therefore, the higher protein intake during the in-season to prevent loss of muscle mass in these
participants may be justified.
during the in-season period, carbohydrate consumption was carefully timed around exercise.
glycogen is an important fuel substrate during resistance training [ 14], with glycogen depletion
reported to reduce exercise performance [ 15]. carbohydrate supplementation before and during
resistance exercise improves performance of high volume, exhaustive exercise [ 16,17], a characteristic
typical of bodybuilding training [ 2]. during in-season energy restriction, carbohydrate consumption
following resistance training would assist in the replenishment of muscle glycogen, facilitatingsports 2017 ,5, 76 10 of 13
improved recovery and enhanced capacity to maintain training volume and intensity in subsequent
sessions [ 18]. bodybuilders commonly perform multiple training sessions in a single day during the
in-season, typically an aerobic and a resistance training session [ 2], therefore post-exercise carbohydrate
ingestion would be important for maintaining training consistency.
study participants discussed using a weekly refeed day during the in-season period to boost
training performance, provide a mental rest, and assist in body fat reductions. intermittent energy
restriction for weight loss has garnered significant recent clinical and research interest due to its
hypothetical capacity to alleviate metabolic and behavioral adaptations associated with reduced energy
intake. these adaptations include increased appetite associated with neuropeptide expression [ 19–21],
reduced energy cost of physical activity [ 22], and hormonal effects that promote fat deposition and
loss of lean mass [ 19,20]. intermittent energy restriction, or metabolic rest periods, have been shown to
achieve similar weight and fat loss as continuous energy restriction, despite a higher overall energy
intake [ 21,22]. animal studies have shown that acute energy restoration (<24 h) can attenuate, or even
abolish the orexigenic neuropeptide expression resulting from energy restriction [ 23,24]. the short-term
restoration of energy balance, particularly through increased carbohydrate ingestion, would also
increase intramuscular glycogen stores allowing greater resistance exercise performance .
during the peak week, participants discussed the use of several strategies to assist in achieving
a lean, vascular appearance. carbohydrate loading, and fluid and sodium manipulation had all
been used by participants, with varying success. only one empirical study has directly assessed
changes in muscle girth from carbohydrate loading, finding no significant changes in relaxed or tensed
muscle girths following a three-day carbohydrate depletion and subsequent three-day carbohydrate
load [ 26]. this suggests carbohydrate loading may not produce the desired increase in muscle volume.
fluid and sodium manipulation to enhance visual appearance has not been empirically studied,
however the desired improvement in muscle size and definition may not be obtained. manipulating
fluid intake to cause dehydration will result in a loss of fluid from all compartments, not just
subcutaneous tissue [27,28] . muscle water content is reduced [ 27], which may reduce muscle volume,
an undesirable outcome for a competitive bodybuilder. additionally, plasma volume is decreased
with dehydration [ 27]; the common practice of “pumping up” prior to posing on stage may be less
effective in increasing muscle size due to the detrimental effects of reduced plasma volume on muscle
blood flow and volume [ 13]. similarly, the manipulations in sodium consumption will not change the
volume of the intracellular or extracellular compartments, only modifying urinary sodium output [ 29].
in the weeks following competition, participants reported an increased energy intake from a
wider variety of foods, often leading to significant weight regain. daily energy intake in the first two
days post-competition was approximately twice that of the four weeks pre-competition in female
bodybuilders, with an increase in body mass of 3.9 kg in the three weeks after competition [ 30].
similarly, an average weight regain of 5.9 kg was reported in a group of male bodybuilders, with 46%
of these participants reporting binge-eating episodes in the days immediately following competing [ 31].
supplement use, predominantly creatine and protein powders, was common amongst the
bodybuilders interviewed, while “pre-workout” formulas had been trialled, with unwanted side effects
commonly reported. protein and creatine supplementation have been demonstrated to be effective
for increasing lean mass and strength [ 32,33]. the efficacy of so-called “pre-workout” supplements
is yet to be confirmed. these products contain a combination of key ingredients such as creatine,
caffeine, arginine, -alanine and selected plant extracts [ 13,34,35]. efficacy would be dependent on the
supplement ingredients, and some produce side effects such as acute increases in blood pressure and
difficulty sleeping .
bodybuilders have historically relied on magazines, other successful competitors, and more
recently the internet, for information on dietary strategies [ 1]. this study identified the internet, in
particular bodybuilding and strength and conditioning websites and forums, as a primary source of
education, as well as other bodybuilders and coaches. in addition to the internet [ 36], athletes have
previously identified family members, other athletes, coaches and registered dietitians as importantsports 2017 ,5, 76 11 of 13
sources of information regarding nutrition and dietary supplements [ 37–39]. dietitians were not
identified as sources of information by participants in this study, suggesting that their role needs better
promotion amongst bodybuilders. with skills in dietary assessment, planning and body composition
measurement, as well as evidence-based strategies demonstrated to assist in the accrual of lean mass,
dietitians have much expertise to provide bodybuilders, particularly novices who were considered by
participants in this study to be vulnerable to inappropriate strategies promoted on the internet.
study limitations include use of a small, homogeneous sample. experienced bodybuilders were
purposively sampled, therefore these results may not reflect the wider bodybuilding population,
particularly inexperienced bodybuilders.
5. conclusions
despite the common perception that bodybuilders follow extreme, unproven methods, the
experienced bodybuilders in this study reported predominantly using dietary strategies recognized as
evidence-based. however, inexperienced bodybuilders may be vulnerable to more extreme strategies
based on advice widely disseminated on the internet and social media.
novel strategies identified in this study warrant further investigation. intermittent energy
restriction, and hormonal responses associated with short-term energy restoration, should be
studied to determine benefits for weight loss whilst maintaining lean mass in both lean-athletic
and obese populations. peak week strategies implemented by bodybuilders, such as fluid and sodium
manipulation, require further investigation to determine their efficacy and safety.

abstract: many nutrition practices often used by bodybuilders lack scientific support and can be
detrimental to health. recommendations during the dieting phase are provided in the scientific
literature, but little attention has been devoted to bodybuilders during the o -season phase. during
the o -season phase, the goal is to increase muscle mass without adding unnecessary body fat.
this review evaluated the scientific literature and provides nutrition and dietary supplement
recommendations for natural bodybuilders during the o -season phase. a hyper-energetic diet
(~10–20%) should be consumed with a target weight gain of ~0.25–0.5% of bodyweight /week for
novice /intermediate bodybuilders. advanced bodybuilders should be more conservative with the
caloric surplus and weekly weight gain. su cient protein (1.6–2.2 g /kg/day) should be consumed
with optimal amounts 0.40–0.55 g /kg per meal and distributed evenly throughout the day (3–6 meals)
including within 1–2 hours pre- and post-training. fat should be consumed in moderate amounts
(0.5–1.5 g /kg/day). remaining calories should come from carbohydrates with focus on consuming
sucient amounts ( 3–5 g /kg/day) to support energy demands from resistance exercise. creatine
monohydrate ( 3–5 g /day), caeine (5–6 mg /kg), beta-alanine (3–5 g /day) and citrulline malate (8 g /day)
might yield ergogenic e ects that can be beneficial for bodybuilders.

1. introduction
bodybuilding is more than a sport; it is an art and culture. it di erentiates itself from performance
sports as the athletes are judged on appearance rather than athletic ability on competition day.
bodybuilders pose onstage where they are judged on muscularity, definition, and symmetry. during a
season, bodybuilders go through three di erent phases: muscle-gaining phase (o -season), dieting
for competition (contest preparation) and the competition itself. most of the literature surrounds the
dieting phase .
however, the scientific literature on dietary recommendations for bodybuilders in the o -season
is lacking. this is an important gap, as most of a bodybuilder’s career is spent in this phase where
the goal is to increase muscle mass while minimizing excess increases in fat mass. bodybuilders
are known for having rigid attitudes toward food selection, meal frequency, nutrition timing and
supplementation [ 2]. historically, information about nutrition and supplementation has been passed
on by bodybuilding magazines and successful competitors, but recently more information has emerged
via the internet and forums [ 3,4]. as such, many of the dietary strategies used by bodybuilders do not
have sound scientific support and there is evidence in the scientific literature that a number of these
strategies, including the heavy use of dietary supplements, can be detrimental to health [5–7].
sports 2019 ,7, 154; doi:10.3390 /sports7070154 www.mdpi.com /journal /sportssports 2019 ,7, 154 2 of 19
since bodybuilders spend most of their time in the o -season, there is a clear need for safe and
evidence-based nutrition and dietary supplement recommendations for this population. there is also
evidence that some bodybuilders, especially high-level competitors in natural bodybuilding, may be
interested in evidence-based information [ 8]. the purpose of this review is to evaluate the scientific
literature on topics related to nutrition and dietary supplementation relevant for bodybuilders in the
o-season and provide practical recommendations for energy intake, macronutrients, meal frequency,
nutrient timing and dietary supplements.
2. energy
during the o -season, the main goal of a bodybuilder is to increase muscle mass while minimizing
increases in fat mass through the use of resistance training and maintaining a positive energy balance.
in order to accurately assess energy requirements for bodybuilders during the o -season, training
volume, frequency and intensity must be considered. during the o -season phase, it has been reported
that bodybuilders resistance train 5–6 times a week, exercising each muscle group 1–2 times weekly [ 9].
it was also reported that they follow a high-volume training routine with 4–5 exercises per muscle
group, performing 3–6 sets per exercise, 7–12 repetition maximum (rm) for each set with 1–2 min rest
between sets. training session duration was reported as ~40–90 min. however, training plans can
dier greatly from athlete to athlete. the average calorie intake of bodybuilders must also be evaluated.
in the o -season, energy intake is usually substantially higher compared to the dieting phase with
dietary intakes among male bodybuilders being reported at an average intake of ~3800 kcal /day during
the o-season and ~2400 kcal /day during the dieting phase [ 2]. due to the limited information available
on nutritional strategies during the o -season phase, this review will discuss optimizing strategies
during this phase. however, readers are encouraged to read the review by helms and colleagues
on the dieting phase which also covers recommendations for macronutrients, meal frequency and
nutrient timing as well as dietary supplements .
positive energy balance
positive energy balance has been shown to have an important anabolic e ect, even in the absence
of resistance training [ 10]. however, combining a positive energy balance with resistance training
provides the most e ective method to ensure the anabolic e ects are directed toward increasing
skeletal muscle mass [ 11,12]. the ideal size of the energy surplus to gain lean mass while limiting
the accumulation of adipose tissue may di er based upon training status. in untrained subjects,
a substantial energy surplus of ~2000 kcal combined with resistance training has been shown to
provide robust weight gain where the contribution from lean body mass (lbm) can be as high as
100% [ 12]. however, in trained subjects, substantial energy surpluses might not be necessary or
beneficial. one study conducted on elite athletes looked at the e ect of dietary guidance on body
composition changes among elite athletes when resistance training was combined with di erent energy
surplus magnitudes. one group with an average bodyweight of 75 kg, consumed energy ad libitum
(2964 kcal) to reach a very small surplus, while a second group with an average body weight of 71 kg
received dietary counseling and consumed ~600 kcal more than the ad libitum group .
both groups followed the same 4-days per week resistance training program over a period of
8–12 weeks. the researchers hypothesized that the hyper-energetic group would have greater gains
in body weight and lbm. although the hyper-energetic group achieved greater increases in lbm
compared to those eating ad libitum, this failed to reach statistical significance (1.7 kg vs. 1.2 kg,
respectively). further, compared to the ad libitum group they had significantly larger increases in fat
mass (1.1 kg vs. 0.2 kg, respectively). the researchers concluded that a 200–300 kcal per day surplus in
highly trained athletes might be more appropriate than 500 kcal to minimize the risk of unnecessary
increases in body fat. untrained subjects, further from their genetic ceiling of muscle mass, may be
able to gain muscle at a faster rate compared to trained individuals.sports 2019 ,7, 154 3 of 19
rates of muscle growth may slow as an individual becomes more advanced [ 14]. thus,
larger energy surpluses may be more beneficial for novice bodybuilders, while advanced bodybuilders
might benefit more from conservative hyper-energetic diets to limit unnecessary increases in body fat.
previous studies have recommended bodybuilders to consume a slightly hyper-energetic diet with a
~15% increase in energy intake above maintenance in the o -season [ 15]. however, this does not take
into consideration the training history and experience level of the individual bodybuilder. because
the ability to gain muscle mass is limited, an aggressive surplus can result in an unnecessary gain
of body fat, which would increase the duration or the severity of subsequent contest prep periods,
consequentially increasing the duration or severity of low energy availability. thus, the number of
calories a bodybuilder consumes above maintenance may need to be set based on experience level,
then adjusted based on rate of weight gain and changes in body composition. given that bodybuilders
often experience rapid weight gain after a competition, it might be beneficial to have a target for weight
gain per week and adjust accordingly [16,17].
however, initially post competition, a faster weight gain to help restore a competitor to a healthy
status both psychologically and physiologically might be beneficial before the rate of weight gain
is slowed to limit excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. in the scientific literature, it has been
recommended to aim for a target weight gain of ~0.25–0.5 kg per week when trying to increase lbm
and minimize gains in fat mass [ 14,18]. for the advanced bodybuilder, a potential 2 kg increase in
body weight on a monthly basis might be too excessive and result in unnecessary accrual of body fat;
thus, this rate should be considered with caution. based on the current evidence, it may be appropriate
to recommend bodybuilders to consume a slightly hyper-energetic diet (~10–20% above maintenance
calories) in the o -season and recommend advanced bodybuilders to aim for the lower end of this
recommendation, or even be more conservative if substantial increases in fat mass are experienced.
given that bodybuilders on average consume 45 kcal /kg during the o -season, the recommended
surplus would equate to approximately 42–48 kcal /kg . aiming for a target weight gain of ~0.25–0.5%
of bodyweight per week might be useful, while also adjusting energy intake based on changes in body
composition. in addition, it may be more appropriate to look at average weekly weight changes based
on daily (or multiple times per week) weigh ins to limit the errors of daily fluctuations of weight that
may occur during the week. once caloric surplus is determined, the next step would be to distribute
the calories between protein, fats and carbohydrates.
3. protein
skeletal muscle protein turnover is the relationship between muscle protein synthesis (mps) and
muscle protein breakdown (mpb). skeletal muscle hypertrophy requires a net balance where mps
exceeds mpb. resistance exercise provides the initiating tension stimulus that drives hypertrophy
resulting from cumulative increases in mps after chronic resistance exercise [ 19]; however, increases in
fat free mass (ffm) can be limited if an insu cient daily protein intake is consumed [ 20]. in addition
to the total amount consumed per day, researchers have speculated that the quality of protein may
augment resistance training-induced muscle gain [ 21]. thus, both of these topics will be discussed in
the following sections.
3.1. daily intake
while the current rda for protein in healthy individuals is 0.8 g /kg, twice this amount was
observed to maximize resistance training-induced hypertrophy in a 2018 meta-analysis by morton and
colleagues [ 22]. furthermore, the authors noted “it may be prudent to recommend ~2.2 g protein /kg/d
for those seeking to maximize resistance training-induced gains in ffm”, as 2.2 g /kg was the upper
end of the confidence limit [ 22] and individual di erences dictate that some athletes will have higher
protein needs than others [ 23]. additionally, a “better safe than sorry” recommendation is likely safe
given the lack of apparent harm over 1–2 year trials among lifters consuming protein intakes of at
least 2.2 g /kg [24,25]. finally, the mean and upper 95% confidence limit for protein requirements usingsports 2019 ,7, 154 4 of 19
the indicator amino acid oxidation technique among male bodybuilders on non-training days, were
reported as 1.7 and 2.2 g /kg , respectively—which is similar to the requirement among women
when normalized to ffm .
however, bodybuilders have been reported to consume up to 4.3 g /kg of protein per day
among males, and 2.8 g /kg among females which far exceeds these recommendations [ 2]. guidelines
previously given for bodybuilders in the o -season, were to consume 25–30% of their energy intake from
protein [ 15]. it might be reasonable to argue against giving recommendations based on percentages of
total energy intake, due to the fact that a light individual with high energy requirements might end up
consuming protein which far exceeds what is necessary and required. further, this can also lead to
insucient intakes of carbohydrates and fats if an athlete is targeting a specific caloric intake. thus,
recommending protein requirements based on body weight might be more appropriate. therefore,
bodybuilders should consume a minimum of 1.6 g /kg of protein in the o season, although targeting
closer to 2.2 g /kg may ensure a more consistently optimized response across a greater proportion
of athletes.
finally, among bodybuilders who struggle with o season hunger and subsequently consume
energy intakes that lead to faster rates of weight gain and excess fat accumulation, a higher protein
intake may be useful (if not contraindicated for clinical reasons). in a study by antonio and colleagues,
resistance trained participants consuming more protein (4.4 g /kg per day) and more calories gained
a similar amount of ffm, but did not gain additional body fat compared to a lower protein group
consuming fewer calories [ 28]. likewise, in a follow up study, a group consuming 3.4 g /kg of protein
daily gained a similar amount of ffm, but lost a greater proportion of body fat compared to a lower
protein group, once again, despite a higher energy intake [ 29]. the authors of these “free living” studies
speculated their findings were due to increases in dietary induced thermogenesis via the very high
protein diets. however, this is at odds with a more tightly controlled 2012 metabolic ward study by
bray and colleagues in which the protein content of the diet influenced the proportion of ffm gained,
while total body mass was dictated by the diet’s energy content alone .
thus, while dietary induced thermogenesis may indeed be meaningfully higher with protein
intakes in the 3 g /kg or higher range, the fat loss or lack of weight gain observed by antonio and
colleagues, despite a reported higher energy intake, might also reflect the satiating e ect of very high
protein intakes decreasing actual energy intake, rather than an increase in thermogenesis alone.
3.2. protein quality
essential amino acids (eaa) are the only amino acids required to stimulate the process of mps [ 31].
while all amino acids provide the necessary “building blocks” for the synthesis of new tissue, the amino
acid leucine in particular appears to be especially important as a “metabolic trigger” of mps [ 32].
a sucient concentration of leucine has been suggested to be necessary to reach a “leucine threshold”
which is required to maximally stimulate mps [ 33]. in short, from a muscle building perspective,
protein sources that both trigger a robust mps response (su cient leucine quantity) and provide
the essential building blocks for the construction of new muscle tissue (contain the full spectrum of
essential amino acids in abundance) can be seen as “higher quality”.
while the mechanistic e ect of leucine on mps is beyond the scope of this publication, readers are
encouraged to read a review that covers this topic in detail [ 34]. in general, on a gram per gram basis,
animal-based protein sources typically contain more leucine and eaa, although there are notable
exceptions. soy protein, one of the most common plant-based protein supplements, has all the eaa,
but in a lower amount per gram compared to dairy protein and thus, in one study produced a smaller
increase in mps compared to whey after acute ingestion [ 35]. interestingly, in this same study soy
produced a larger increase in mps than casein, also a “high quality” dairy protein, presumably due to
the slower digestion speed of casein [ 35]. meaning, while the leucine and eaa content of a protein
source certainly should be considered, the acute mps response is not the only variable linked to long
term hypertrophy. indeed, a high-quality but “slow” protein like casein produces a smaller amplitudesports 2019 ,7, 154 5 of 19
mps response initially. however, casein (and other slowly digested proteins) may produce a similar or
larger mps area under the curve when viewed longitudinally compared to a “fast” protein source like
whey, which results in a larger initial increase and then a steep reduction .
more importantly, the acute mps response to a given type of protein should not be viewed from a
reductionist perspective. in the real world, multiple servings of various protein sources are consumed
daily, likely making some of these distinctions in amino acid profile and digestion kinetics moot.
indeed, in a meta-analysis comparing longitudinal body composition changes with di erent types of
protein supplements, there were no significant di erences among participants consuming soy when
compared to whey, other dairy proteins, or beef protein isolate .
as demonstrated in a study comparing groups consuming post-training protein (on top of a diet
already consisting of 25% protein), whether 48 g of whey (containing 5.5 g of leucine) was provided,
or 48 g of rice protein (containing 3.8 g of leucine) was provided, no impact was observed on body
composition changes between groups after eight weeks [ 38]. therefore, when consumed in su cient
quantities (especially considering total daily protein intake) the protein quality of an individual meal
is of less concern. even so, if one was to consume a diet dominated by plant-based protein sources,
there are alternatives to soy and rice. for example, pea protein isolate is rich in both eaa and
leucine. in a 12-week study, a group consuming 50 g of pea protein isolate daily had greater increases
in resistance-training induced muscle thickness compared to placebo, which were not significantly
dierent from a group consuming 50 g of whey .
therefore, in the context of the recommendations in this article, protein quality may only be a
concern if using the low-end range of the protein guidelines (1.6 g /kg), or if consuming a largely plant
based diet. in either case, it might prove beneficial to supplement with leucine and eaa rich sources of
protein—as appropriate based on dietary preference (e.g., dairy proteins or pea protein if vegan)—to
ensure the expected mps response to one’s protein intake occurs.
4. fats
fat is an essential nutrient vital for many functions in the body. however, less is known about the
eect of dietary fat in regard to skeletal muscle hypertrophy. intakes of dietary fat among bodybuilders
have been reported to range from 8–33% of total calories [ 2]. although intramuscular triglycerides can
act as a fuel source during resistance training, they are not a limiting factor since substrates are derived
primarily from anaerobic processes [ 40]. of interest to the bodybuilder, there is evidence in endurance
athletes [ 41] and hockey players [ 42] that low carbohydrate diets (30–45% of energy or lower) may
aect the free testosterone to cortisol (ftc) ratio, which could have a negative impact on recovery.
on the other hand, reducing dietary fat in isocaloric diets from ~30–40% to ~15–25% has resulted in
significant but modest reductions in testosterone levels [43–46].
however, it is not clear that testosterone changes within normal ranges a ect muscle gain
significantly [ 47]. despite the possibility that testosterone levels may be higher when consuming a
greater proportion of energy from dietary fat, actual changes in muscle mass during longitudinal
studies of resistance trained individuals following high fat, ‘ketogenic’ diets have consistently been
inferior to moderate or lower fat approaches with ample carbohydrate [ 48–51]. whether this is due to
changes in exercise capacity, or alterations in ftc ratio, or some other mechanism related to the high
fat or low carbohydrate component of the diet is yet to be elucidated.
however, this indicates that perhaps a more moderate proportion of dietary fat should be
consumed, rather than a low or high intake. in the literature, recommendations of 15–20% and 20–30%
of calories from dietary fat have been proposed [ 15,52]. however, further research is needed to establish
the eect and optimal amount of dietary fat for aiding muscle hypertrophy.
based on current evidence, it may be prudent to recommend that dietary fats should account
for 20–35% of calories—conforming to the american college of sports medicine recommendations
for athletes [ 53]—which under most circumstances would equate to approximately 0.5–1.5 g /kg/day.sports 2019 ,7, 154 6 of 19
further, it should be noted that su cient intakes of dietary protein and carbohydrates should not be
compromised by a high dietary fat intake.
fat quality such as omega 3 and omega 6 might also be of importance for bodybuilders. provided
sucient intake from a high-quality diet containing good sources of these fatty acids, they do not need
to be supplemented. however, it might be challenging for some to consume the optimal amounts.
thus, this will be discussed in further detail in the dietary supplements section.
5. carbohydrates
unlike proteins and fats, carbohydrates are considered non-essential for the human diet because
the body has the ability to produce glucose needed by tissues through gluconeogenesis [ 54]. however,
carbohydrate intake has an important role in the bodybuilder’s diet as a regulator of thyroid hormones
and as a contributor to micronutrient needs [ 55,56]. further, a very low carb diet could limit regeneration
of adenosine triphosphate (atp) and limit the muscles’ ability to contract with high force [ 57,58].
during high intensity exercise, muscle-glycogen is the major contributor of substrate and it has been
shown that glycolysis provides ~80% of atp demand from one set of elbow flexion when taken to
muscular failure [ 59]. in spite of this, part of the glycogen used during this type of exercise can be
resynthesized from lactate, which could reduce the carbohydrate requirement. resistance training has
also been shown to reduce muscle-glycogen by 24–40% in a single session [59,60].
the depleted amount may vary based on duration, intensity and the work completed, but typical
bodybuilding training with higher repetition and moderate loads seems to cause the greatest reduction
of muscle-glycogen stores [ 61]. further, it has been suggested that when glycogen stores are too low
(~70 mmol /kg), this may inhibit the release of calcium and hasten the onset of muscle fatigue [ 62].
low muscle glycogen significantly reduces the number of repetitions performed when three sets of
squats at 80% 1 rm are performed .
however, it has been shown that consuming a diet containing 7.7 g /kg/day of carbohydrate for
48 hours before a training session has no greater e ect on performance compared to 0.37 g /kg/day
when 15 sets of 15 rm lower-body exercise is performed [ 63]. similarly, another study found that
a 70% carbohydrate diet compared to 50% carbohydrate diet had no greater e ect on performance
during supramaximal exercise; however, a diet consisting of 25% carbohydrates significantly reduced
performance .
further, given the observed long term negative e ects on muscle mass recently observed in trials of
resistance-trained populations following ketogenic diets [ 49,51], it might be prudent for bodybuilders
to simply ensure a su cient intake of carbohydrates given these disparate results. thus, while both
moderate and high carbohydrate diets are likely appropriate for bodybuilding, very low carbohydrate
diets may be detrimental to training.
in male bodybuilders, average carbohydrate intakes of 5.3 g /kg/day have been reported during the
o-season [ 2]. however, optimal amounts of carbohydrates have not been established for bodybuilders.
in the literature, recommendations for strength sports, which includes bodybuilding, intakes of
4–7 g /kg/day and 5–6 g /kg have been proposed [ 15,65]. carbohydrate seems to be important for the
bodybuilder, but only moderate amounts may be required to yield benefits. therefore, after calories
have been devoted to protein (1.6–2.2 g /kg/day) and fats (0.5–1.5 g /kg/day), the remaining calories
should be allotted to carbohydrates. however, based on current evidence, it might be reasonable to
consume su cient amounts of carbohydrates in the 3–5 g /kg/day range if possible.
further research is warranted among bodybuilders to conclude if habitually higher or lower
carbohydrate intakes than have been observed might yield further benefits. table 1 summarizes the
recommendations for calories and macronutrients.sports 2019 ,7, 154 7 of 19

fats 0.5–1.5 g /kg 0.5–1.5 g /kg
carbohydrates remaining calories ( 3–5 g /kg) remaining calories ( 3–5 g /kg)
6. nutrient distribution and timing
bodybuilders are reported to have a mean intake of six meals a day [ 66]; however, there are
no studies looking specifically at what might be an optimal meal frequency for this population [ 65].
this high frequency of meals is based on the belief of a greater state of anabolism and even a better use
of nutrients during the day, which could translate into an improvement in body composition.
the concept of timing protein intake to maximize hypertrophy spans a number of dosing strategies.
the first to appear in the literature was the consumption of protein in close proximity to resistance
training. peak mps rates are higher in this period when protein is consumed; thus, this strategy is
proposed to improve the e ciency of skeletal muscle repair and remodeling [ 31]. additionally, due to
the “muscle full e ect”, whereby further provision of protein fails to increase mps until su cient time
has passed, evenly spreading protein intake between multiple meals is another strategy designed to
maximize total daily mps [ 67]. finally, pre-bed consumption of slow-digesting protein (such as casein)
to prevent extended catabolic periods during sleep is the most recently proposed strategy to improve
net daily protein balance . each of these three strategies will be discussed in turn.
6.1. protein dosage
the post-training period permits a higher mps peak when protein is consumed [ 31] and to reach
peak mps, an adequate “threshold” leucine dose may be needed [ 32]. several studies have examined
the protein dosage required to maximize mps after training [ 69–71]. in one, 0, 5, 10, 20 or 40 g of whole
egg protein was consumed following lower-body resistance exercise with 20 g maximally stimulating
mps [ 69]. similar results were also seen in another study, where 20 g whey was su cient to maximally
stimulate post-absorptive rates of mps both at rest and after unilateral leg work at 80% of 1 rm [ 70].
further, 40 g of whey produced no additional increases of mps in this study and lead to oxidation and
urea production.
however, a recent study found that when performing whole-body resistance exercise at 75% of
1 rm , 40 g of whey produced a significantly higher mps response compared to 20 g [ 71]. therefore,
there is a relationship between the volume of muscle tissue that is damaged and stimulated, and the
appropriate intake of protein. interestingly, authors of a 2013 meta-analysis noted that despite short
term tracer studies showing greater mps responses when protein was consumed in the “window of
opportunity” post-training, in longitudinal training studies no significant e ect on hypertrophy was
found when controlling for total daily protein intake regardless of whether protein was consumed
within the window, or outside it .
6.2. nutrient timing
similarly, researchers in a short term tracer study investigating protein dosing over the course
of 12 hours reported a greater mps area under the curve when four 20 g whey protein doses were
consumed every three hours compared to two 40 g doses six hours apart and eight 10 g doses every
hour and a half [ 73]. in theory, given the threshold past which additional protein consumed in a single
sitting does not further contribute to mps [ 69], and due to the post-prandial “refractory period” duringsports 2019 ,7, 154 8 of 19
which mps cannot be maximally stimulated again [ 67], one would conclude that a bodybuilder should
reach—but not exceed—this threshold dose every few hours to maximize long term hypertrophy.
however, authors of a 2018 systematic review on protein supplements including 34 randomized
controlled trials, reported similar lean mass gains among groups using a with-meal (resulting in fewer
protein servings of a high magnitude) and between-meal (resulting in more protein servings of a
moderate magnitude) dosing schedule .
intriguingly, data examining night-time protein feedings display a similar disconnect between
short term mechanistic studies and long-term training interventions. in 2012, the first research
examining the acute response to night-time casein feeding was carried out [ 68]. in it, the authors
reported 40 g of casein consumed before bed was digested, absorbed, and stimulated mps and improved
whole-body protein balance during the overnight period to a greater degree than placebo. additional
acute studies were published in the years following which confirmed [ 75] and also reconfirmed
these findings in an older population [ 76]. in 2015, authors of the first longitudinal study reported
enhanced strength and hypertrophy in a night-time protein-supplemented group compared to a
placebo group .
however, total daily protein was not matched, as the night-time protein group consumed
1.9 g/kg/day while the placebo group only consumed 1.3 g /kg. importantly, in both of the only protein
matched longitudinal studies comparing night-time casein supplementation to earlier-supplemented
groups, no significant di erences in ffm gains were reported between groups [ 78,79]. thus, the question
is the same for each distribution strategy, why are there repeated disconnects between short term
mechanistic studies of mps and long-term research examining actual hypertrophy? the answer may
lie in the methods used in mps studies as participants are fasted, provided only protein powder in
isolation, often given whey (which is digested very quickly) and observed for short periods. these lab
settings result in di erent digestion time courses and amino acid kinetics than occur in the “real world”.
specifically, in these lab conditions baseline levels of amino acids in the body are lower than normal,
and digestion and subsequent delivery of amino acids to muscle is faster.
in free-living conditions, protein is consumed primarily from whole food sources, multiple times
per day, and in conjunction with other foods, all of which delays gastric emptying. for these reasons,
amino acids are titrated into the bloodstream in a slower, more consistent manner; thus, there is
almost always a readily available supply under normal conditions [ 80]. therefore, the e ectiveness
of the “anabolic window” and even protein distribution strategies might not translate to practice.
additionally, lab-specific limitations extend to night-time feeding studies as well. consider for example,
that 26 g of protein from lean steak results in a sustained elevation in mps lasting at least six hours (the
entire time period studied) .
furthermore, 26 g is only ~37% the protein dose contained on average in an american dinner [ 82],
which would take longer to digest due to the larger serving of protein, and the addition of fiber,
lipids and other nutrients which would further delay digestion . therefore, the typical final meal
may already fulfil the intended purpose of a casein shake. with that said, despite these disconnects
between mps and body composition outcomes, there is certainly no harm from attempting these
strategies, especially if implemented in a pragmatic manner that doesn’t introduce additional logistical
strain on one’s daily schedule.
therefore, it might be prudent to recommend bodybuilders to divide their daily intake of
1.6–2.2 g /kgof protein per day into multiple meals each containing ~0.40–0.55 g /kg and ensure
that one of these meals occurs within 1–2 hours before or after training, and one feeding consisting of
a non-whey protein source is consumed 1–2 hours prior to sleep. for example, a 90 kg bodybuilder
might consume 40–50 g of protein at 8–9 am for breakfast, train at 11 am, have 40–50 g of protein at
12–1 pm for lunch /post-training, 40–50 g of protein at dinner between 5–6 pm, and then a final meal of
40–50 g of non-whey protein at 9–10 pm before heading to bed by 11 pm.
carbohydrates consumed peri-workout is often a strategy utilized by athletes to improve
performance in high intensity exercises. complete glycogen resynthesis can be achieved within 24 hourssports 2019 ,7, 154 9 of 19
following a glycogen depleting training bout if su cient amounts of carbohydrate are consumed [ 83].
however, only 24–40% of muscle glycogen is depleted following resistance exercise [ 59,60]. therefore,
an amount of 3–5 g /kg carbohydrates per day would most likely be enough for glycogen resynthesis.
this high daily carbohydrate intake likely also reduces the impact of pre-workout carbohydrate timing
on exercise performance.
consuming carbohydrates with protein post-workout is often claimed to have a an anabolic
eect due to the secretion of insulin. although insulin has been shown to have anabolic e ects [ 84],
at physiological levels its release has little impact on post-exercise anabolism [ 85]. further, several
studies have shown no further e ects on muscle protein synthesis post-exercise when carbohydrates
are combined with amino acids [86,87].
in addition to bodybuilders lacking the need to emphasize glycogen replenishment, protein
enhances post workout mps to maximal levels even without the addition of carbohydrate [ 86,87].
while there is certainly no harm in post-workout carbohydrate consumption, doing so is unlikely
to enhance long term hypertrophy as discussed in prior reviews [ 1,88]. therefore, it may be best to
focus on consumption of adequate daily carbohydrate and base carbohydrate distribution around the
workout on personal preference.
7. dietary supplements
in a recent survey among bodybuilders, it was reported that all of the participants were taking
dietary supplements [ 9]. the most common dietary supplements were: protein supplements (86%),
creatine (68%), branched chain amino acids (67%), glutamine (42%), vitamins (40%), fish oil (37%) and
caeine/ephedrine containing products (24%).
although protein supplements are popular among bodybuilders, they are predominantly used in
the same way as whole foods to reach protein targets. therefore, they will not be discussed in further
detail. readers are encouraged to read the issn position stance on this topic [ 89]. further, covering all
supplements commonly used by bodybuilders is beyond the scope of this review. rather, the focus
will be on dietary supplements that might potentially yield an ergogenic e ect and supplements that
can insure su cient intake of micronutrients and essential fatty acids.
7.1. creatine monohydrate
creatine phosphate is found in high concentrations in skeletal and cardiac muscle where it acts as
an energy source [ 90]. creatine can also be obtained through the diet in individuals who consume
meat; however, creatine concentrations in meat are reduced with cooking .
numerous studies have observed increases in muscle mass and strength following creatine loading
phases typically of 20 g daily for around 1 week oftentimes followed by maintenance phases of 2–3 g
creatine daily [ 92]. however, the loading phase may not be necessary. muscle creatine saturation
following 3 g creatine monohydrate supplementation for 28 days was shown to be similar to creatine
monohydrate consumption following the typical loading phase .
most individuals do not reach 3 g daily through the diet and supplementation may be necessary.
there are numerous forms of creatine in supplements on the market of which creatine monohydrate is
the most studied. newer versions of creatine such as kre-alkalyn [ 94] and creatine ethyl-ester [ 95] have
not been shown to be superior to creatine monohydrate despite typically having a higher price point.
therefore, we recommend consumption of 3 g creatine monohydrate daily. timing of creatine does
not seem to matter as saturation of creatine phosphate stores takes approximately 28 days to reach
maximum concentrations when 3 g /day is consumed and does not have an acute e ect .
7.2. ca eine
one of the most used dietary supplements among bodybuilders are stimulants, in particular
caeine [ 9]. in addition to increasing arousal [ 96], caeine can reduce pain and perceived exertion
during exercise [ 97] and improves calcium handling which may increase power output [ 98]. studies onsports 2019 ,7, 154 10 of 19
resistance exercise have found that ca eine reduces fatigue and increases strength [ 99,100]. however,
not all studies have shown an ergogenic e ect on resistance exercise [ 101]. studies that have shown an
ergogenic e ect have used high dosages of ca eine (5–6 mg /kg) which is at the upper limit of what is
considered a safe dosage [ 99,100]. however, it may be advisable to consume the minimum e ective
dosage for an individual as tolerance can arise from regular intake [ 102]. due to the acute e ect
of caeine, it is advisable to consume ca eine approximately 1 hour before exercise [ 99]. however,
the half-life of ca eine is roughly 3–9 hours; therefore, it may be advisable to consume ca eine earlier
in the day to support healthy sleep patterns if exercise is performed later in the day [ 103]. further
research is warranted for a consensus on the use of ca eine regarding resistance exercise but based
upon the current evidence a dosage of 5–6 mg /kg consumed pre-exercise might yield an ergogenic
eect on resistance exercise performance.
7.3. beta-alanine
ingestion of 4–6 g beta-alanine has been shown to elevate muscle carnosine levels [ 104]. carnosine
acts as a ph bu er in skeletal muscle and may delay the onset of muscle fatigue during high-intensity
exercise [ 105]. a meta-analysis concluded that beta-alanine might yield ergogenic e ects during
high-intensity exercise lasting 60–240 seconds [ 104]. further, there were no beneficial e ects in exercise
lasting <60 seconds. most of the studies included in the meta-analysis looked at endurance exercise.
however, there is evidence that beta-alanine supplementation may improve muscular endurance
in resistance-trained athletes [ 105] and may improve body composition [ 106]. further studies are
warranted to examine the ergogenic e ect of beta-alanine on body composition and performance.
however, given that bodybuilders often train with more than 10 repetitions per set and often times
include intensity techniques such as drop sets, rest pauses, myo reps and others, beta alanine might
yield a benefit in the endurance of these sets .
thus, it might be reasonable for a bodybuilder to consume 3–5 g beta alanine daily during high
repetition training phases or training phases where they are incorporating several intensity techniques
that prolong the duration of a set. similar to creatine monohydrate, beta-alanine does not have an
acute e ect as muscle carnosine concentrations takes approximately 4 weeks to reach concentrations
that would yield an ergogenic e ect, provided that su cient amounts are consumed daily .
7.4. citrulline malate
recently, citrulline malate has gained popularity among bodybuilders. the potential ergogenic
eect is thought to be increased atp production and citrulline malate’s potential ability to act as a
buering agent . consumption of 8 g citrulline malate has been shown to increase repetitions to
failure by as much as 50 percent [ 107–110], decrease muscle soreness by 40 percent [ 107] and improve
maximal strength and anaerobic power .
however, not all studies have observed ergogenic e ects of citrulline malate consumption.
two recent studies failed to show improvement in performance, augment the muscle swelling response
to training, alleviate fatigue or increase focus and energy following citrulline malate supplement in
recreational resistance trained men [112,113].
a recent meta-analysis by trexler et al. analyzed 12 studies on cm for strength and power
performance [ 114]. although they only found a small e ect size (0.20), they concluded that this might
be relevant for high level athletes where competition outcomes are decided on small margins, such as
high level competitive bodybuilders. it is advised to consume citrulline malate approximately 60 min
before exercise to allow for su cient absorption.
further research is warranted to determine the e cacy of citrulline malate for resistance exercise.
at this stage, the data indicates either a beneficial or neutral e ect on performance. thus, based on
current evidence, 8 g /day of citrulline malate consumed pre-exercise might have some benefits that are
of interest to bodybuilders.sports 2019 ,7, 154 11 of 19
7.5. multivitamin /mineral
historically, bodybuilders have utilized restrictive diets that eliminate foods or entire food
groups. as a result, numerous vitamin and mineral deficiencies are common. in dieting bodybuilders,
deficiencies including calcium, vitamin d, zinc, iron and others have been observed [ 115–117]. however,
a majority of literature on dietary practices of bodybuilders is from the 1980’s and 1990’s; therefore,
more recent data is needed .
more recently, dieting practices in bodybuilders who use a traditional restrictive diet were
compared to competitors using a macronutrient-based dieting approach where no food or food group
was o limits [ 118]. not surprisingly, competitors using a more flexible dieting approach were found
to have fewer micronutrient deficiencies. specifically, vitamin e, vitamin k, and protein were found
to be significantly lower in women utilizing strict dietary approaches compared to those using more
flexible approaches. in the current review, we recommend using a flexible dieting approach where no
food or group is eliminated from the diet.
thereby, micronutrient deficiencies are less likely to occur, especially considering that competitors
in the o season have a greater caloric allotment than those dieting for a show which should allow
them to incorporate a greater variety of foods.
nevertheless, it may be advisable to recommend a low dose multivitamin /mineral supplement
(100% rda) as a failsafe to prevent any major micronutrient deficiencies while also emphasizing
consumption of a variety of foods daily to meet micronutrient needs.
7.6. omega 3
polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond three atoms away from their terminal methyl group
are known as !-3 or omega-3 fatty acids (o3). low intakes of o3 in western diets in relation to other
sources of dietary fat (such as omega-6 fatty acids) are associated with poorer multi-spectrum health in
epidemiological studies [ 119]. thus, specific focus on dietary changes to supply eicosapentaenoic and
docosahexaenoic acids (epa and dha)—the dietary shortfall most common in the western world—is
of interest; but it is worth noting the measurement, interaction, and e ect of o3 and omega-6 fatty
acids in relation to health is unclear and beyond the scope of this article. readers are referred to [ 120]
for a review.
in addition to health, there is interest regarding the potential anabolic e ects of epa and dha
supplements [ 121] which are typically supplied via fish oil or in some cases algae oil. however,
there are mixed data on fish oil’s ability to augment the muscle protein synthesis response to protein
ingestion. while a 2014 review paper highlighted a number of studies which found fish oil can enhance
the response [ 122], a recent study found no e ect on the mps response to a resistance training session
and post-workout protein ingestion [ 123]. more importantly, data on longitudinal hypertrophy are
few [ 124] and studies on resistance training performance are mixed [ 125] and largely not applicable
or di cult to appraise due to the use of untrained participants or non-standardized, ecologically
unrealistic training relative to bodybuilding.
in a recent review specifically addressing the question of whether or not o3 supplements might
enhance hypertrophy [ 126], the authors concluded there is not currently su cient evidence to make
such a claim. while additional research is needed before o3 supplementation (or diet alterations for that
matter) can be recommended for muscle-building purposes, the health benefits of o3 supplementation
are worth noting. for example, recent meta-analyses have reported fish oil supplementation reduces
symptoms of depression [ 127], decreases risk of cardiac death [ 128], decreases blood pressure [ 129],
and decreases waist circumference [ 130]. therefore, physique athletes may consider fish (or algae) oil
supplementation daily (2–3 g epa /dha) for general, multi spectrum health, but future study is needed
to make recommendations regarding bodybuilding performance. table 2 summarizes recommendation

8. summary
bodybuilders in the o -season should focus on consuming a slightly hyper-energetic diet (~10–20%
above maintenance calories) with the aim of gaining ~0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. advanced
bodybuilders are advised to be more conservative with the caloric surplus and the rate of weekly
weight gain. dietary protein intake is recommended to be 1.6–2.2 g /kg/day with a focus on su cient
protein at each meal (0.40–0.55 g /kg/meal) and an even distribution throughout the day (3–6 meals).
dietary fats should be consumed at moderate levels, neither too low nor high (0.5–1.5 g /kg/day),
to prevent an unfavorable ftc ratio and to prevent reductions in testosterone levels. after calories
has been devoted to protein and fat, the remaining calories should come from carbohydrates while
ensuring su cient amounts are consumed ( 3–5 g /kg/day). minor benefits can be gained by consuming
protein (0.40–0.55 g /kg/meal) in close proximity to training sessions (1–2 hours pre-exercise and within
1–2 hours post-exercise). cm (3–5 g /day), and ca eine (5–6 mg /kg) should be considered as they can
yield ergogenic e ects for bodybuilders. further, ba (3–5 g /day) and citm (8 g /day) are dietary
supplements that can be considered as they may potentially be of benefit for bodybuilders, depending
on individual training regimens. bodybuilders who are unable to consume a su cient intake of
micronutrients and essential fatty acids in their diets should consider supplementing these nutrients
to avoid deficiencies. the primary limitation of this review is the lack of large-scale and long-term
studies on bodybuilders in the o -season. further research is warranted in this population to optimize
nutrition and dietary supplement recommendations.

abstract — as pointed at livestrong.com, olympic 
weightlifters are quite possibly the strongest and most skilled 
lifters on earth. the ability to put nearly 300 kg over head or 
clean and jerk three times their bodyweight is feat of strength 
unmatched in other sports. while this takes years of dedicated 
training, diet is also critical as optimal nutrition is essential for 
peak performance. nutritional mi sinformation can do as much 
harm to the ambitious athlete as good nutrition can help. in 
this study, we propose ontology-based personalized dietary 
recommendation for weightlifting to assist athletes meet their 
requirements. this paper describes a food and nutrition ontology working with a rule-based knowledge framework to 
provide specific menus for different times of the day and 
different training phases for the athlete’s diary nutritional 
needs and personal preferences. the main components of this 
system are the food and nutrition ontology, the athletes’ 
profiles and nutritional rules for sports athletes. 
keywords- ontology; food; nutrit ion; athlete; weightlifting. 
i. introduction 
weightlifting demands extreme strength and power to lift 
very heavy weights in a controlled manner. the aim of these 
athletes is to build muscle bulk and target the main muscles that are used for the bar movement. a high level of muscularity is therefore required by both male and female competitors. maintaining low body fat is also a physical requirement often demanded to optimize the power to weight 
ratio of lifters, helping to achieve best performance. despite 
requiring a high muscle mass, control of athletes weight is very important given that competitions are divided into weight-class categories . 
besides providing the energy for training and for its 
recovery, in the case of weightlifting and other strength-power sports, nutrition also promotes training adaptations, including skeletal muscle hypertrophy . a summary of the reported dietary intake of adult strength-power athletes in training, regarding to macronutrient consumption, reported that weightlifters consume a greater number of daily servings of protein-rich sources when compared with other athletes. as a result, the protein intake of male weightlifters has been reported to range between 1.6 g/kg/day and 3.2 g/kg/day [3-5], which is high when compared with the 
recommended 1.2–1.7 g/kg/day for resistance training athletes. furthermore, weightlifters derive approximately 
40–44% of their daily energy intake from dietary fat [1-5], which is also well above the acceptable range for health and athletic performance of 20–35%. this is probably a consequence of their greater intake of protein-rich animal products. 
conversely, the reported carbohydrate intakes in 
weightlifters of 2.9–6.1 g/kg/day [1, 3-5] are insufficient 
according to the current recommended levels of 7–8 
g/kg/day for athletic individuals . combined, these reports suggest that the dietary habits of male weightlifters may not yield the desired training gains and/or health benefits due to the emphasis placed on protein consumption (with high fat) at the expense of adequate carbohydrate ingestion . 
ontology-based personalized dietary recommendation 
for weightlifting is one way to help athletes meet their requirements. some athletes are willing to follow a menu that has been created for them but many athletes do not take this approach; rather, they look to modify their current diet. with an expert system all of them will be benefited. moreover, it can be used by not only athletes but also coaches or sport nutritionists who take charge of making a menu for athletes. 
ii. r
elated work 
there are some relevant research works, such as those 
described in [6-9]. the research work by fodholi et al designed and developed a daily menu assistance in the context of a health control system of a population. this project uses ontology to model a nutrition needs domain, 
implementing a rule-based inference engine. the system is 
implemented as a semantic web application, where users enter abstinence foods and personal information so the system can calculate several parameters and provide an appropriate menu from database. 
cantais et al. designed a food ontology for diabetes 
control from a nutrition viewpoint to support health care of diabetes patients. the ontology was developed based on some referenced nutrition guides for diabetes patients. the food ontology consists of 177 classes 53 properties and 632 instances. thirteen major classes of food types were defined including unprocessed aliments, major miscellaneous categories and food types determined by the main ingredient.

 some of the defined properties include nutrition elements 
such as fat, fiber, carbohydrate, etc. 
also for diabetes control, hong and kim 
implemented web-based expert system for nutrition counseling and management based on ontologies. this system uses food, dish and menu database which are fundamental data to assess the nutrient analysis. clients can search food composition and conditional food based on 
nutrient name and amount. the system is able to organize 
food according to korean menus, and it is able to read nutrient composition of the each food, dish and menu. 
the food-oriented ontology-driven system (foods) 
 is another ontology based expert system of a counseling system for food or menu planning. it uses a food-oriented ontology to implement a system which has two user interfaces, one for cookers and another for costumers or users that want advice on meals. 
suksom et al. implemented a rule-based system for a 
personalized food recommender system, aimed to assist users in daily diet selections based on some nutrition guidelines ontology and focused on personalization of recommendation results by adding user’s health status information that may affect his/her nutrition need. 
our work adopted some food ontology design schemes 
from [6-10]. however, comparing to [8-12], our work was focus only in weightlifting athletes. we extended the personalized food ontology defined in [8, 10] by adding information related to athletes’ training program that may affect their nutrition need and unifying the food and sport ontologies. our recommendations are based on sport nutrition guidelines, which were transformed into rule-based knowledge. 
iii. n
utrition background 
a. periodized nutrition for the yearly training programme 
in the course of a year, athlete training is divided in 
different cycles manipulating variables such as volume, frequency and intensity in order to meet season demands and schedule. as these variables change, the food of athletes should also change to meet different nutritional demands. usually, a one year training cycle, a macro-cycle, is divided in micro-cycles, ranging from one day to a week, and meso-cycles, ranging from a week up to three months. also, four phases can be identified in training: general preparation, specific preparation, competition, and transition. as the training plan comprises phases and cycles to manipulate training variables, so food needs should be in synch with this plan in order to maximize the athlete results in each phase (fig. 1). 
b. energy requirement 
meeting energy needs is a nutrition priority, in order to 
maximize athletic performance. to this goal, the energy 
provided to the athlete should equal the energy he needs, 
being this estimation a critical factor for nutrition. besides 
the training plan, energy needs of an athlete depends on his 
prior nutritional status and sex, being factors such as heredity, age, body size, influential in such calculation.

yearly training phases for strength and power athletes . 
nutrition recommendations for a 70-kg strength and power 
sport athlete . (adapted from [2, 11]) 
one of the most common ways to estimate the total 
energy expenditure (tee) is using the called factorial 
method, by first estimate resting metabolic rate (rmr) using a prediction equation and then multiply rmr by an appropriate activity factor (both general and specific activity) (1). in general it is best to use the rmr prediction equation most representative of the population with whom you are working. for both active men and women, the cunningham equation best predicted rmr; the harris-benedict equation was the next best predictor . 
tee= (rmr x general activity)+(rmr
(per hour) x mets) (1)

estimating energy requirement for adults (adapted from ) 

 figure 3. the metabolic equivalent for weightlifting . 
c. daily menu 
a menu defines the food composition that is consumed 
by an athlete for his/her meal in one meal time or in one day. 
a balanced menu is a menu which consists of varied foods 
in appropriate quantities and proportions, to fulfill the 
nutritional needs of the athlete . 
to calculate the total calories contained in every menu, 
we used the data from the dataset “nutritive values thai food” provided by nutrition division, department of health, ministry of publish health (thailand) and a software named inmucal provided by the institute of nutrition, at mahidol university. 
iv. o
ntology 
for this project we need a knowledge based framework 
and for that, it was developed a unified ontology merging nutrition and sports concepts. 
ontology in the computers science field is a data model 
that describes concepts (classes) in a specific domain and also describes their relationships. ontology was successfully used to share concepts across applications and exchange information; ontology exchange information based on semantics rather than using syntax . 
compared to object-oriented programming where we 
center around methods on classes, and we make design decisions based on the operational proprieties of classes, in 
ontology we make the decisions based on the structural 
proprieties of a class. 
there are four main elements of ontology, concepts or 
classes, individuals, properties and relationships that together make it a knowledge base. classes are collections of objects, sets or abstract groups, describing concepts in the ontology specific domain; they can contain both a subclass that describes more specific concepts and an individual. an example of a class would be a food class that would contain various subclasses like food type and food group. individuals are the basic components of ontology. the individuals may be concrete concepts like a specific menu or an ingredient or an abstract one like numbers. properties are related to individuals or class, as they are something that define or explain them. there are two types of properties: 
datatype used to assign a valor to a property or class, (e.g., a 
menu hasenergie 150j) or object type meaning an object can be attributed to other (e.g., menu a hasingredient b). the last of the main elements of ontology are the relationships that consist in all relations between classes and individuals. so, ontology is the exact description of things and the relationship among them. v. e
xpert recommender engine 
the recommender engine will interpret the ontology data 
in owl (web ontology language) format that is a standard ontology language designed for processing web information. 
owl is written in xml and so, it can be exchanged 
between different computers and different applications. 
the expert engine will perform questions on the 
ontology data to get back the nutrition/food data saved there, as well as inferring on athlete information and preferences to give the menu recommendations for each specific case. the application for insertion of the data will be developed in java and will work with jess api for the interaction with the ontology. 
vi. i
mplementation 
the unified sports and nutrition ontology was developed 
in protégé , a free and open-source platform that allows users to build an ontology in owl. protégé also allows the use of swrl rules and query’s and the use of pellet , a reasoner used in this project. 
 
 
figure 4. knowledge base framework for food and nutrition 
recommendation engine in sports 
a. ontology development 
the development of the ontology involves specification 
and definition of the four main elements of ontology such as classes or concepts, the individuals, the proprieties and all the relationships. in this case we decided starting with only one specific sport the weightlifting by following a top-down approach. we started with the definition of the most general concepts in the domain and then, subsequently, the specialization of those concepts. such ontology was modeled around four main concepts: athlete, food, nutrition and sports and it consists of 120 classes, 950 individuals and 25 properties. 
the athlete concept: the athlete class represents the 
concept of the athlete profile with the athlete information saved in a database providing all the necessary information about the needed personal data like height, weight, age, etc... 
the food concept: the food class is the root of this 
problem and represents the concept of the food which will have multiple subclasses: food group, food type, process type, and type of meals. 

 • food group - this subclass will be divided in 5 
groups of food like the food pyramid, all the 5 groups will 
have subclasses for even more specific type of food (e.g., in meat group there are different types of meat like beef or pork). this is the biggest concept where all the ingredients of all the menus will be. 
• food menu – this subclass represents the different 
type of food items like main dish, dessert snacks or beverages. inside these subclasses will be all available menus/items 
divided in those 3 categories. 
• process type – represents how that food item was 
cooked (e.g., baked, roasted, and smoked). 
• type of meals – this subclass represents the food 
item advised time of ingestion. (e.g., during dinner, lunch, 
breakfast or during training sessions). all food items can have more than one type. 
the nutrition concept: the nutrition concept 
represents all the nutrition needs of an athlete and all the nutrients present in an ingredient/food item. 
• nutrient type – all nutrients presented in all 
ingredients and food items are here listed. 
• nutrition level – the level of nutrients per ingredient 
and food item and represented here, like low carbohydrates and high level of fat. 
• nutrition goal – the amount of nutrients that meet 
the requirement. 
• nutrition plan – special plan that athletes need, like 
maintain weight/ increase muscle or decrease weight/maintain muscle. 
the sports concept: the sport concept represents 
athletes’ characteristic which affect their nutrition need. 
• anthropometric characteristic – body type of athletes 
consist of endomorph, mesomorph, and ectomorph, which correspond to body fat percentage of athletes. 
• periodization of training – the systematic planning of 
athletes training consists of general preparation phase, specific preparation phase, competition phase, and transition phase. in each phase, the athletes’ energy need is different. 
after all the ontology was modeled and implemented, we 
validated the owl using pellet reasoner. 
b. rule engine 
the rules were developed using swrl protégé editor, 
and all tested from the sqwrl tab which runs a protégé 
application that allows the query of the ontology inside protégé. the rules were defined using nutrition and sports knowledge for the recommended energy and nutrients need for specific training types and specific ages, height etc. the more restrictions the user has less food menus will be recommended. 
all those rules were written in swrl (semantic web 
rule language), a language that allows us to make rules and query the ontology via java, so we can get the menus in our application with the specific rules constrains. 
c. expert recommender engine application 
the java application was developed so a user can add all 
the needed data and then received the specific menus; all the data can be saved in a database for future using and gives the 
ability of updating that data. the application will work with the api jess , a rule engine full compatible with owl and swrl. 
the first menu of the user application [fig. 6] will be the 
athlete profile menu where the athlete will add his information (age, name etc...). all data will be saved for future using in a database, and some variables of that menu 
can be retrieved from sensors. for requiring menu 
recommendations, various variables have to be added both in training part and preferred food. in the training part: weight, body fat and muscle mass goal, athlete level, load, repetitions of training and the date of the competition will be necessary for better estimation of the energy needs to achieve the goal. 
the athletes can also choose the non-favorite and 
favorite menus and ingredients, so the system will avoid the non-favorite and will choose between the menus with the favorite ingredients. they can also choose for how many days they want the chosen recommendations and if they want the menus with supplements or not and want the special process type of cooking (e.g., steaming, baked etc.) [fig. 7]. 
after the submition of the training and food preferences 
it will be possible to received various types of reports like via email or in the application itself [fig. 8]. all the user requests together with the profile data will be transformed in a sqwrl query that will question the ontology, producing all the recommendations results following the rules previously saved into the ontology.

vii. conclusion and future work 
this paper describes the development of a personalized 
food and nutrition ontology working with a rule-based knowledge framework to provide specific menus for the 
weightlifter’s diary nutritional needs and personal preferences. 
on-going work is the real-time data gathering through 
sensors and automatically updating of database without user intervention. this will give the possibility of, after every sensor measuring, the recommendations can be updated for the better athlete needs, and it will also allow the use of the 
alerts every time some parameter is not correct or the athlete 
is failing with his training and is goal. 
for being able to communicate with the sensor via java 
application we will need to create a dll (dynamic linked library) in c++, because java doesn’t allow us to directly communicate with hardware. for the communication between the dll and java we will use jni (java native interface), a framework that specifies a communication protocol between java code and external library’s, so enabling java interface with the c++.

 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
by 
brandon m roberts1, eric r helms2, eric t trexler3, peter j fitschen4 
the popularity of physique sports is increasing, yet th ere are currently few comprehensive nutritional guidelines 
for these athletes. physique sport now encompasses more th an just a short phase before competition and offseason 
guidelines have recently been published. therefore, the goal of this review is to provide an extensive guide for male and 
female physique athletes in the contest preparation and recovery period. as optimal protein intake is largely related to 
one’s skeletal muscle mass, current evidence supports a rang e of 1.8-2.7 g/ kg. furthermore, as a benefit from having 
adequate carbohydrate to fuel performance and activity, lo w-end fat intake during contes t preparation of 10-25% of 
calories allows for what calories remain in the “energy budget” to come from carbohydrate to mitigate the negative impact 
of energy restriction and weight loss on training performa nce. for nutrient timing, we recommend consuming four or 
five protein boluses per day with one consumed near training an d one prior to sleep. during competition periods, slower 
rates of weight loss ( ≤0.5% of body mass per week) are preferable for attenu ating the loss of fat-free mass with the use of 
intermittent energy restriction strategies, such as diet breaks and refeeds, being possibly beneficial. additionally, 
physiological and psychological factors are covered, and po tential best-practice guidelines are provided for disordered 
eating and body image concerns since physique athletes p resent with higher incidences of these issues, which may be 
potentially exacerbated by certain tradit ional physique practices. we also revi ew common peaking practices, and the 
critical transition to the post-competition period. 
key words : physique, bodybuilding, nutrition, cont est preparation, competition recovery. 
 
introduction 
physique athletes are judged on aesthetics. 
originally the name of the sport, bodybuilding is now one of many competitive classes under the 
umbrella of “physique competition” which have 
emerged over the past decade including men’s physique, classic bodybuilding and several classes for females (alwan et al., 2019). while recommendations for natural bodybuilders were previously published by helms et al. in 2014 (helms et al., 2014), research has grown at a rapid 
rate, including an increase in the number of studies 
on females. contest preparation has become longer than in the past, with a focus on the post-competition phase transition. for example, the length of contest 
preparation and recovery has increased from four months in the 1980s and 1990s (bamman et al., 1 9 9 3 ) , t o e i g h t m o n t h s o r m o r e i n r e c e n t c a s e 
studies (pardue et al., 2017). recently, offseason 
recommendations for physique competitors were published by iraki and colleagues (iraki et al., 2019). therefore, the goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for male and female physique athletes with a focus on the contest preparation period from nutrition 
and supplement recommendations, to 
physiological and psychosocial adaptations, as well as best practices for peaking and post-competition recovery.

methods 
the electronic databases pubmed, 
sportdiscus, google scholar, and medline 
were searched. each author was responsible for a 
section of the manuscript. the publications found were screened by each author responsible for a section. long-term human studies were primarily 
selected, acute studies were accepted when directly relevant, and animal studies were used to help determine mechanisms when no such human 
research was available. authors cross-checked one 
another’s sections twice during the draft phase to ensure accurate interpre tation of the included 
studies and appropriate scientific rationale behind recommendations. since this review is an expanded and updated evidence-based guide, a 
narrative review style was chosen. 
nutrition 
while preparing for competition, the goal 
of physique athletes is to maintain lean muscle mass while decreasing body fat. contest preparation can last for 4 months or more during which calories are reduced and exercise is 
increased or maintained (helms et al., 2014; kistler 
et al., 2014; pardue et al., 2017; rossow et al., 2013). a recent review reported male bodybuilders consumed ~3800 calories per day and females consumed ~2000 during non-competition phases (spendlove et al., 2015). yet, in the competition phase calories can be as low as ~1600 for both sexes 
(chappell et al., 2018; halliday et al., 2016; 
robinson et al., 2015). total caloric recommendations for indi viduals vary widely, 
therefore we will focus on macronutrient ranges relative to body weight or overall percentages. macronutrient intake 
protein 
protein plays a critical role in physique 
sport. meta-analytic data support mean intake of ~1.6 g/kg/day to maximize fat-free mass gains with 
resistance training; importantly, these data had an upper confidence interval of 2.2 g/kg/day (morton et al., 2018), which agrees with the upper confidence interval (~2.2 g/kg/day) in a group of 
male bodybuilders using the indicator amino acid 
oxidation method (bandegan et al., 2017). recent work in aspiring female physique athletes has also indicated that higher relative to lower protein diets (2.5 g/kg/day vs. 0.9 g/kg/day) increase lean body mass in the non-competition phase (campbell et 
al., 2018). according to a recent review, physique 
 
athletes generally exceed these recommendations with males consuming 2-4 g/kg/day and females 0.8-2.8 g/kg/day (spendlove et al., 2015). another 
study reported ranges of 2.7-3.3 g/kg/day in 
competitors (chappell et al., 2018); ultimately, it seems physique athletes easily meet and often 
exceed protein recommendations. 
muscle protein synthesis (mps) is often 
used as a surrogate of how protein intake or exercise affects muscle mass accrual. physique 
athletes are in a caloric deficit during competition 
preparation, which in other populations decreases basal mps by ~27% after only 5 days and 19% after 10 days (areta et al., 2013; pasiakos et al., 2010). furthermore, there are data specifically in lean individuals indicating muscle protein breakdown (mpb) is elevated as early as 10 days into a caloric 
deficit (carbone et al., 2014). the combination of 
reduced mps and increased mpb results in a negative net protein ba lance, which could be 
attenuated with high protein intakes. however, there are very few studies, observational or intervention-based, comparing high and low 
protein intake in athletes during a caloric deficit 
(campbell et al., 2018; helms et al., 2015; longland et al., 2016; walberg et al., 1988). for example, a recent study found that over a 4-week period, a 40% caloric deficit with 2.4 g/kg/day of protein per day resulted in more lbm preservation and more fat mass loss compared to a group consuming 1.2 
g/kg/day (longland et al., 2016). this and previous 
data suggest higher prot ein consumption during a 
caloric deficit may be advantageous (campbell et al., 2018; helms et al., 2014; longland et al., 2016; walberg et al., 1988). 
protein has other important roles for 
physique athletes such as inducing fullness and 
satiety. a recent meta-analysis found higher 
protein meals increase acute ratings of fullness (dhillon et al., 2016). in fact, in an energy deficit of 7 days, 2.9 g/kg/day of protein resulted in less cravings than 1.8 g/kg/day (roberts et al., 2018). in a pilot crossover study on resistance-trained athletes, lower stress, mood disturbance and diet 
related stress were reported during the high 
protein (2.8 g/kg/day) compared to the moderate protein (1.6 g/kg/day) phase (helms et al., 2015). taken together, consuming a high protein diet may help physique athletes increase satiety, reduce hunger, and mitigate stress. 
when assessing protein recommendations 
 by brandon m roberts et al. 81 
© editorial committee of jo urnal of human kinetics 
for athletes from various research groups, there is 
a converging range from 1.6-2.7 g/kg/day of protein (hector and phillips, 2018; helms et al., 
2014; jager et al., 2017; morton et al., 2018; stokes 
et al., 2018). since there is currently little evidence 
that high protein intake negatively impacts health 
in non-clinical populations, we recommend 1.8-2.7 g/kg/day, or up to 3.5 g/kg/day for those specifically attempting to mitigate hunger, so long as such high intake does not displace fat or 
carbohydrate in the diet to a degree that it impairs 
performance. carbohydrate 
carbohydrates are consumed by physique 
athletes to maintain training performance and help recovery post-training. a systematic review of dietary intake in bodybuilders reported large 
variability in carbohydrate intake with males 
consuming 243-637 g/day (3 -7.2 g/kg), and females 
160-415 g/day (2.8-7.5 g/kg) (spendlove et al., 2015). in a recent compar ison of macronutrient to 
strict-dieting competitors, males consumed ~323 g and females ~218 g per day during the non-
competition phase (ismaeel et al., 2018). another 
study on men’s physique athletes compared dietary intake in the cutting versus bulking phases. they found during the bulking phase participants consumed ~ 261 g (2.98 g/kg) and ~178 g (2.3 g/kg) in the cutting phase (lenzi et al., 2019). finally, in a recent study of contest preparation, males 
reduced carbohydrate intake (on average) from 4.4 
to 4.1 g/kg and females from 3.9 to 3.3 g/kg (chappell et al., 2018). an interesting observation in this study was that carbohydrate intake remained comparatively elevated (5.1 g/kg) among males who placed higher (spendlove et al., 2015). cumulatively, these data indicate there is a wide 
range of carbohydrate intake typically consumed 
by physique athletes. 
previous publications recommended 4-7 
g/kg for bodybuilders (slater and phillips, 2011), which aligns with observational ranges seen in the literature. this range also allows room for individual differences. yet, athletes attempting to 
achieve extremely lean conditions may, at least in 
a certain phase of preparation, need to consume less than 4 g/kg. therefore, we recommend carbohydrate intake should be adjusted so that training performance is optimized while consuming adequate caloric intake to reach the desired physique. a realistic range for physique 
 
athletes that covers potential phases requiring very low energy intake to reach the desired level of leanness is 2-5 g/kg per day. to improve satiety 
during low carbohydrate (and subsequently low 
energy) phases, we recommend the majority of carbohydrates come from whole grains, fruits, and 
vegetables while avoiding higher energy-density sources (holt et al., 1995; rolls et al., 1998; zhang et al., 2018). fat 
previous recommendations for dietary fat 
intake for bodybuilders were 15-20% of total calories (helms et al., 2014; lambert et al., 2004). indeed, in observational studies, physique athletes fall within this range. a systematic review reported fat intake among males was 19-241 g/day (8-33% of calories) and from 9 – 124 g/day (9-35%) among 
females (spendlove et al., 2015). a case study of a 
male bodybuilder in competition preparation reported maintenance of fat intake at 0.7 g/kg over the course of the study yet the percentage of calories from fat decreased from 29 to 21% (pardue et al., 2017). another study reported a female 
competitor’s intake of 0.35 g/kg (15%) during the 
final 10 weeks of the contest phase (petrizzo et al., 2017). furthermore, a cross-sectional study 
reported similar starting points of fat intake (0.8 g/kg) for both sexes, with only a small reduction at the end of contest preparation among females (0.6 
g/kg) (chappell et al., 2018) . absolute fat intake in 
other studies of competitive bodybuilders was 
reported around 40-65 g/day in some cases (mitchell et al., 2017a; suryanarayana et al., 1969) and 79-90 g/day in others (mitchell et al., 2018). cumulatively, these data indicate physique athletes, again, have fat intake that vary widely across individuals and phases which occasionally 
fall outside previously recommended ranges. 
dietary fat is often the last macronutrient 
of concern for physique athletes since protein and carbohydrates help build and preserve lean body mass, increase satiety, and aid training performance. while there is evidence in other populations suggesting dietary fat and 
testosterone levels are correlated (sallinen et al., 
2004; volek et al., 1997), recent findings in bodybuilders suggest this relationship is likely due to energy availability rather than fat intake specifically. for example, a case-study of a male bodybuilder demonstrated a 72% decrease in testosterone while minimal relative changes in fat 
 82 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
intake occurred (pardue et al., 2017). these data 
and others (maestu et al., 2010) suggest changes in the hormonal milieu may be inevitable when 
preparing for a physique competition. 
furthermore, it is problematic extrapolating physiological changes in obese subjects to those who are lean. there is also a lack of interventional studies of dietary fat and the impact on hormone levels in physique athletes, which makes it difficult to understand how fat intake could affect their 
physiology (heni et al., 2014; suryanarayana et al., 
1969). 
dietary fat intake of 20-35% has been 
previously recommended for athletes with a lower level of 15-20% for bodybuilders (helms et al., 2014; lambert et al., 2004). however, it is unlikely all individuals will be able to stay within this range 
during contest preparation since levels as low as 
~9% have been reported in the literature (spendlove et al., 2015). protein and carbohydrate should be prioritized for muscle retention, performance and satiety, and we therefore recommend fat intake of 10-25% to allow for 
individual variability and dietary flexibility yet we 
caution strongly against very low fat intake for long periods (helms et al., 2014). nutrient timing 
in the context of physique athletes, 
“nutrient timing” can be discussed in relation to the number, timing and macronutrient 
composition of meals consumed in proximity to 
training, sleep, and one another. for example, bodybuilders consume a mean of 6 daily meals 
(chappell et al., 2018), which may be based on the concept that frequent protein consumption translates to greater anabolism, more complete digestion, and/ or greater energy expenditure. in 
addition to the consumption of peri-workout 
protein, carbohydrate consumption is also a focus of physique athletes in the post-training period, as a way to both enhance the anabolic response to training and for rapid glycogen replenishment. another long-employed strategy in physique circles is consuming slow-digesting proteins (such 
as casein) prior to sleep to prevent an extended 
catabolic period. however, this has only recently been studied by sports scientists (res et al., 2012). the potential merits of each of these strategies are discussed in this section. 
 
protein dosage per-meal and in the post-training period 
during the postprandial period after a 
protein bolus, additional protein fails to increase 
mps until sufficient time has passed – known as the “muscle full effect”. therefore, the even spread of protein servings over the course of the day is theorized to maximize the 24 hour mps area under the curve (atherton et al., 2010). however, the first 
protein dosing strategy to appear in the literature 
was consuming protein shortly following 
resistance training. this strategy was proposed to improve the efficiency of skeletal muscle repair and remodeling as peak mps rates are higher when protein is consumed in the post-training period (tipton et al., 1999); howe ver, a “threshold” leucine 
dose must be consumed for this to occur (rieu et 
al., 2006). researchers examined peri-workout 
protein boluses in multiple investigations to determine the dose needed to maximize mps (macnaughton et al., 2016; moore et al., 2009; witard et al., 2014). following lower-body resistance exercise, a 20 g dose of egg protein 
stimulated mps to a grea ter degree than smaller 
doses of 5 g or 10 g, and a plateau occurred at a larger dose of 40 g (moore et al., 2009). a similar outcome was observed in another study, in which 20 g whey protein resulted in a maximal stimulus following lower body resistance training, without a greater increase when 40 g was consumed 
(witard et al., 2014). however, when performing 
whole-body resistance exercise rather than lower body only, 40 g of whey produced a significantly higher mps response compared to 20 g (macnaughton et al., 2016). thus, when greater amounts of muscle mass are exposed to a stimulus, greater intake of protein is likely required to 
optimize adaptation. given these acute findings, 
one would speculate that the specific timed dose of protein in relation to the volume of training would be a critical aspect for longitudinal hypertrophy. however, despite consistent short-term findings of enhanced mps when protein is consumed in the post-training period, authors of a 2013 meta-
analysis reported no significant effect on 
hypertrophy when controlling for total daily protein intake in longitudinal studies, regardless of timing (schoenfeld et al., 2013). protein spacing and pre-sleep consumption 
interestingly, a similar disconnect between 
acute and chronic data exists in protein 
 by brandon m roberts et al. 83 
© editorial committee of jo urnal of human kinetics 
distribution research. for example, in a 12 hour tracer study of mps, the area under the curve was 
highest when four 20 g whey protein doses were 
consumed every three hours versus two 40 g doses 
six hours apart, and eight 10 g doses every hour and a half (areta et al., 2013). theoretically, given the “muscle full effect” post protein-feeding which creates a “refractory period” during which additional protein cannot further enhance mps (atherton et al., 2010; moore et al., 2009), a 
physique athlete should therefore reach, but not 
exceed, this dose every few hours after the refractory period ends to maximize longitudinal gains in muscle mass. yet, in a 2018 systematic review of protein suppl ement distribution, the 
authors noted similar fat free mass changes between individuals consuming fewer protein 
s e r v i n g s o f a h i g h d o s e c o m p a r e d t o t h o s e 
consuming more protein servings of a moderate dose (hudson et al., 2018). 
likewise, this disconnect has also been 
observed when comparing short term and longitudinal night-time protein feeding studies. 
the first investigation of the acute response to pre-
sleep casein consumption was performed in 2012 (res et al., 2012). the researchers reported that compared to a placebo, a 40 g dose of casein enhanced protein balanc e to a greater degree 
during sleep, which was subsequently replicated (kouw et al., 2017; trommelen et al., 2018). in the 
first long-term study, researchers observed greater 
muscle mass and strength increases in a group consuming protein before going to bed, compared to a group consuming a placebo (kouw et al., 2017). importantly, in this study total protein was unmatched. while the placebo group consumed 1.3 g/kg in the 24-hour period, the protein-
supplemented group consumed 1.9 g/kg (morton 
et al., 2018). contrasting this finding, in the only two 24-hour protein matched studies comparing long-term outcomes between casein night-time supplementation and grou ps consuming casein 
earlier in the day, significant between group differences were not reported (antonio et al., 2017; 
joy et al., 2018). 
the explanation of why disparate 
outcomes are observed between short-term hypertrophy-proxy analyses (mps) and long-term protein distribution studies examining body composition, is likely due to the methods utilized in mps tracer studies. specifically, participants are 
 
often provided only pr otein powder, fasted, 
measured over hours, and are typically provided whey which is a fast digesting protein. thus, initial 
amino acid levels are lower, digestion is faster, and 
amino acid delivery is quicker. these lab-based digestion and amino acid kinetics differ substantially from “free- living” conditions when 
protein is consumed from whole foods, multiple times per day, in combination with other foods, which slows digestion and subsequent amino acid 
delivery. indeed, in the “real world”, amino acids 
may often be available at any given time point (schoenfeld and aragon, 2018). pre-sleep protein research also shares some of these lab-specific limitations. as an example, an elevation in mps lasts at least six hours (the entire time period studied) after consumption of lean steak providing 
26 g of protein (pennings et al., 2013); yet 26 g is 
only slightly more than one-third the protein in an average us dinner (kim et al., 2016). furthermore, 
the typical us dinner takes longer to digest not only because of the higher protein content, but due to the addition of other nutrients which would 
further delay digestion such as fiber and dietary fat 
(schoenfeld and aragon, 2018). despite the limitations inherent to short term tracer studies, and the lack of theoretical proof in long term studies of muscle gain, from a physique perspective there is nothing to be lost and only a potential for gain by implementing a meal 
schedule which adheres to what would 
theoretically maximize the daily mps area under the curve. 
to conclude with an example in line with 
our protein recommendations, a physique athlete consuming 3 g/kg of protein could eat four meals containing 0.75 g/kg or five meals containing 0.6 
g/kg per day. furthermore, the physique 
competitor could simply ensure they consumed one meal 1-2 hours prior to sleep with protein from a non-whey protein source, and finally, that one of their meals occurred within 1-2 hours before and after training. 
meal frequency effects on bo dy composition, appetite 
and energy expenditure 
physique athletes seeking muscle gain in 
the offseason eat comparable amounts to the high end of what olympic athletes often consume (spendlove et al., 2015). as the goal is not only to fuel performance, but to increase muscle mass 
between competitive seasons, a large volume of 
 84 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
food is consumed to achieve an energy surplus. the observation that bodybuilders consume 6 meals per day on average (chappell et al., 2018) 
may be a function of practicality, rather than a 
reflection of physiological necessity or optimality. while longitudinal data have not borne out the efficacy of manipulating the frequency of protein-
feedings to enhance hypertrophy, smaller more frequent eating occasions may theoretically aid the digestive process in the offseason and in clinical 
sports nutrition texts they are recommended as 
more feasible than simply eating more at existing meals (dean and burke, 2006). indeed, greater hunger and desire to eat is reported by those consuming more frequent, smaller meals (perrigue et al., 2016), and a moderate association between meal frequency and total energy intake is reported 
among elite athletes (burke et al., 2003). yet, recent 
large-scale epidemiological data indicate more frequent feedings (>3) are associated with increases in the bmi (kahleova et al., 2017). furthermore, the existing meta-analyses and reviews of meal frequency interventions do not support an 
association between higher meal frequencies and 
fat loss, improved metabolic health or increased energy expenditure (hutchison and heilbronn, 2016; raynor et al., 2015; schoenfeld et al., 2015). therefore, we recommend physique athletes consume a moderate meal frequency with an even protein distribution. 
peri-workout carbohydrate 
the rationale for consuming carbohydrate 
following, during, and prior to training for bodybuilders is to facilitate glycogen replenishment for future resistance training sessions, maintain intra-session performance, and fuel proximal resistance training bouts, 
respectively (mitchell et al., 2017a). however, 
complete resynthesis can be achieved within 24 hours following glycogen depletion when ample carbohydrates are consumed (jentjens and jeukendrup, 2003) and bodybuilders do not typically train the same muscle groups on subsequent days, such th at performance would be 
impacted by glycogen depletion (hackett et al., 
2013). indeed, most bodybuilders train each muscle group 1-2/week (hackett et al., 2013). furthermore, only 24 – 40% of muscle glycogen is 
depleted during standard volumes of resistance training (macdougall et al., 1999; tesch et al., 1986). to conclude, trai ning performance in 
 
subsequent sessions is unlikely to be impaired if carbohydrates are not consumed in the post workout period, and hypertrophy is also not likely 
to be enhanced by the additional consumption of 
carbohydrate alongside post-workout protein, as insulin rises to adequate levels to fully suppress mpb via the consumption of amino acids alone (aragon and schoenfeld, 2013; helms et al., 2014). 
glycogen is not the only mechanism by 
which carbohydrate intake could enhance or 
preserve resistance training performance when 
consumed near a training bout. indeed, no greater effect on performance was observed after consuming a diet contai ning 7.7 g/kg/day of 
carbohydrate for 48 hours compared to only 0.37 g/kg/day when 15 sets of 15rm lower-body exercise were performed (mitchell et al., 1997). 
given this finding, it seems the body is capable of 
maintaining adequate glycogen in the face of carbohydrate restriction via metabolic conversions 
of other substrates (volek et al., 2016), which is 
sufficient to sustain resistance training performance if ample calories are still consumed. 
however, in the context of a calorically restricted 
diet, there is evidence that lower carbohydrate intake can impair bodybuilding performance (walberg et al., 1988) and that consumption of carbohydrates prior to training may improve it (dudgeon et al., 2017). for example, one study found consumption of carbohydrate after an 
overnight fast resulted in the performance of 
greater training volumes compared to water (bin naharudin et al., 2019), although subjects were habitual breakfast eaters, which may have impacted the results. furthermore, positive outcomes may be unrelated to muscle glycogen levels, and rather a result of stabilization of blood 
glucose, or perhaps liver or brain glycogen 
replenishment, or a central effect on delaying or reducing fatigue. 
some (bastos-silva et al., 2019; decimoni 
2018), but not all studies (clarke et al., 2015; dunkin and phillips, 2017; painelli et al., 2011) show that carbohydrate mouth rinsing can increase 
resistance training volume or delay fatigue 
(bazzucchi et al., 2017). however, aggregate findings are inconsistent, and the exact mechanisms are elusive. thus, further exploration of the effect of peri-workout carbohydrate intake for the purposes of enhancing bodybuilding training performance is needed. with that said,

mouth rinsing provides a unique potential for dieting physique athletes to enhance performance 
via carbohydrate, without additional energy 
consumption. 
in total, insufficient evidence exists to 
strongly state that pre-, intra- or post-training carbohydrate consumptio n enhances resistance 
training performance or hy pertrophy; however, it 
seems prudent that physique athletes consume a meal containing easily digestible carbohydrate 
within ~2 hours prior to training to avoid any 
potential decrement to performance. furthermore, there would be no harm in attempting a mid-session mouth-rinse with a glucose-based drink as an attempt to maintain or improve performance during contest preparat ion, although future 
research is needed to confirm the efficacy of this 
practice. 
supplements 
dietary supplements appear to be a major 
component of the dietary strategies implemented by physique athletes. a re cent study by chappell 
et al. (2018) surveyed ph ysique competitors on 
their nutrition habits in th e months leading up to a 
natural bodybuilding competition. the authors noted the competitors routinely consumed between five and seven supplements during the contest preparation period; males averaged 7.0 supplements, whereas females 5.4. protein powder was most commonly consumed, with survey 
results indicating 75.0% of males and 88.9% of 
females consumed them. multivitamin supplements were used by 53.5% of males and 60% of females. the number of competitors using 
branched-chain amino acids (bcaas), creatine, fat burners, individual amino acid supplements, pre-workout supplements, and omega-3 fatty acids 
ranged from 39.4 to 49.4% in males, and 19.9 to 
53.5% in females. 
protein powders are not inherently more 
efficacious than any other high-quality protein source and are generally viewed as a convenient means of accomplishing the previously discussed guidelines for protein intake. as such, protein 
supplementation will not be discussed in detail. 
given the potential for diets to become restrictive late in contest preparation, ingestion of a well-formulated multivitamin supplement may be an effective strategy for ensuring suitable micronutrient intake, alth ough efforts should be 
made to obtain sufficient nutrition from whole 
 
food sources. given that multivitamins are a convenient means of obtaining nutrients that would otherwise be obtained from a well-
structured diet, multivitamins will not be covered 
in detail either. rather, th is section discusses the 
dietary supplements with the greatest potential to directly enhance competitive outcomes for physique athletes. creatine 
creatine is one of the most commonly used 
supplements among physique athletes. daily 
endogenous creatine prod uction is approximately 
one gram per day (cooper et al., 2012), and omnivorous diets typica lly provide about 1-2 
grams per day. nonetheless, muscle creatine stores are generally only 60-80% saturated (kreider et al., 2017). by supplementing with creatine, muscle 
storage of creatine an d phosphocreatine are 
maximized, thereby delaying fatigue and enhancing performance. cr eatine supplementation 
has been studied extensively, with results typically showing improvements in repetitive, high-intensity exercise performance of up to 10-20%, 
along with increased lean body mass when used in 
conjunction with resistance training (kreider et al., 2017). to date, no legal dietary supplement has been shown to enhance resistance training performance as robustly and reliably as creatine, and both the international society of sports nutrition (kerksick et al., 2018) and the 
international olympic committee (ioc) 
(maughan et al., 2018) list creatine in their top tier of evidence-based dietary supplements for performance enhancem ent. to increase 
intramuscular creatine storage to an ergogenic degree, loading protocols often involve ingestion of 20 grams of creatine per day (or approximately 
0.3 g/kg of body mass) divided between four equal 
doses, for approximatel y one week, followed by 
single daily maintenance doses of approximately five grams (0.07 to 0.1 g/kg). alternately, evidence suggests that individuals who wish to bypass the loading stage can achieve ergogenic elevations in muscle creatine storage by consuming 
maintenance doses for approximately four weeks 
(hultman et al., 1996). a large body of evidence suggests creatine is safe and well-tolerated with any gastrointestinal discomfort alleviated by splitting the total creatine intake into smaller doses (ostojic and ahmetovic, 2008). the most consistent s i d e e f f e c t i s a n a b r u p t i n c r e a s e i n b o d y m a s s ,

typically in the range of 1-2 kg. this initial weight gain is attributable to increased water retention due to the osmolytic nature of creatine; in theory, 
this fluid should largely be stored in the 
intracellular fluid compartment and should not substantially affect the outward appearance of the p h y s i q u e i n a n e g a t i v e manner. nonetheless, it 
would be prudent for phys ique athletes that are 
not creatine users to avoid a loading phase within the final 1-2 weeks prior to a competition. 
caffeine 
caffeine is a primary component of many 
pre-workout supplements and fat burners; thus, 
finding its way into two categories of common bodybuilding supplements. as such, chappell et 
al. (2018) observed above-average daily caffeine intake in both male (322 mg/day) and female (252 
mg/day) physique athletes. the ioc recognized 
caffeine as one of the few dietary supplements with evidence supporting its capacity to directly improve exercise performance in a recent consensus statement (maughan et al., 2018). while 
the early literature investigating performance-
enhancing benefits of caff eine focused largely on 
endurance exercise outcomes (costill et al., 1978), 
more caffeine research pertaining to strength and power has emerged in the last fifteen years. a meta-analysis published in 2018 (grgic et al., 2018) indicated caffeine exerts a small, but statistically significant positive effect on maximal strength and 
power, such as one-repe tition maximum and the 
vertical jump. there is also evidence that caffeine enhances muscular enduranc e (grgic et al., 2019), 
which likely relates more closely to habitual t r a i n i n g o f p h y s i q u e athletes. finally, the 
numerous physiological adaptations that accommodate energy restri ction in lean athletes 
are likely to induce leth argy, hunger, and reduced 
energy expenditure. caffeine use during contest preparation may confer benefits extraneous to its ergogenic effect by favorably affecting subjective the energy level, appetite, and energy expenditure (harpaz et al., 2017). taken together, current evidence would suggest that caffeine has the 
potential to directly improve performance for 
physique athletes. dosing strategies often involve consuming a dose of 3-6 mg/kg of caffeine, approximately one hour prior to exercise (maughan et al., 2018). doses beyond 3-6 mg/kg do not appear to be more efficacious (goldstein et al., 2010), and it should be noted that despite an acute 
 
lethal dose that is estimated to be around 10,000 mg, it is often conservatively recommended that healthy adults restrict their daily caffeine intake to 
no more than roughly 6 mg/kg per day (nawrot et 
al., 2003). nitric oxide precursors 
nitric oxide (no) precursors, such as 
citrulline and dietary nitrate, are also common components of multi-ingredient pre-workout formulas. nitric oxide is a gaseous cell signaling 
molecule with widespread effects throughout the 
body. as reviewed by ba iley et al. (2011), the 
potential mechanisms by which no may enhance exercise performance incl ude exercise efficiency, 
mitochondrial respiration, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium kinetics, vasodilation, glucose uptake, and muscle fatigue (bailey, 2011). collectively, these 
exercise-related effects of no have prompted 
interest in the potential ergogenic applications of ingredients that increase no production. due to the short half-life and poor stability of no (kelm, 
1999), supplementation st rategies for increasing 
no production are restricted to supplementation 
with precursors of no. in the nitric oxide synthase-
dependent (nos-dependent) pathway of no production, arginine is th e direct precursor of no. 
unfortunately, arginine has relatively poor oral bioavailability (schwedhelm et al., 2008), and exercise studies with ar ginine supplementation 
have largely yielded underwhelming results 
(bescos et al., 2012). in contrast, citrulline has 
substantially greater bioavailability, and oral citrulline supplementation efficiently increases 
blood arginine levels (schwedhelm et al., 2008). perez-guisado and jakeman (2010) found citrulline enhanced repeti tions to fatigue during 
resistance exercise. a recent meta-analysis (trexler 
et al., 2019) reported a small, but significant effect 
of citrulline-based supplements for such outcomes. the exact mechanisms underlying the ergogenic effects of citrulline-based supplements are not entirely elucidated at this time. for resistance training studies, the most common dosing strategy yielding ergogenic effects involves consuming 8 
grams of citrulline malate (presumably in a 2:1 
citrulline to malate ratio), approximately one hour before exercise. 
in an alternate pathway of no production, 
dietary nitrate is reduced to nitrite, and further reduced to no, in an nos-independent manner (bailey, 2011). in the past decade, a substantial 
 by brandon m roberts et al. 87 
© editorial committee of jo urnal of human kinetics 
body of literature reports inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice, a source of dietary nitrate, enhances endurance exercise capacity (mcmahon et al., 
2017). in contrast, few studies have evaluated the 
effects of nitrate on resistance exercise. mosher et al. (2016) found six days of beetroot juice supplementation (containing 400 mg nitrate per dose) enhanced bench press repetitions to fatigue over three sets taken to failure. similarly, beetroot juice enhanced leg extension speed and power 
(coggan et al., 2015), in addition to explosive force 
production in fatigued muscle (tillin et al., 2018). these effects on muscle contractile function may relate to no-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and myofilament calcium sensitivity (coggan and peterson, 2018). studies documenting ergogenic effects of nitrate tend to 
provide at least 400-500 mg of nitrate 2-3 hours 
prior to exercise, and chronic dosing strategies appear to enhance performance more reliably than acute supplementation. furthermore, there is mechanistic evidence to suggest no plays a permissive role in muscle hypertrophy by 
promoting satellite cell activation (anderson, 
2000). as such, the pharmacological blockade of endogenous no production blunts hypertrophic adaptations to overloading in rats (smith et al., 2002), and treatment with isosorbide dinitrate (an 
no-donor) enhanced exercise-induced hypertrophy in mice (leiter et al., 2012). 
nonetheless, whether the findings from these 
mechanistic studies translate to healthy humans consuming no precursor supplements is unknown. as a cautionary note, there is large variability in the dosing of beetroot in commercial supplements (bailey et al., 2011). in summary, there are mechanistic justifications for the use of 
no precursors by physique athletes, and 
preliminary studies suggesting beneficial effects on strength and power. however, more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions about the ergogenic applications of no precursors, including citrulline and nitr ate, for the purposes of 
enhancing resistance tr aining performance and 
hypertrophy. 
beta-alanine 
as reviewed previously (trexler et al., 
2015), beta-alanine is the rate-limiting precursor to carnosine synthesis. wh en supplemented, beta-
alanine increases the intramuscular concentration of carnosine, which functions as an intracellular 
 
buffer. proton accumulati on occurs during high-
intensity exercise due to rapid atp turnover. this proton accumulation leads to a local reduction in 
ph, which is thought to co ntribute to fatigue and 
reduced capacity for force production. baseline muscle carnosine concentrations vary depending on a number of factors including age, sex, training status, muscle fiber type distribution, and dietary habits, but beta-alanine supplementation has been 
shown to increase muscle carnosine by 64% after 
four weeks (harris et al., 2006) and by 80% after ten 
weeks (hill et al., 2007). be ta-alanine is recognized 
as an effective ergogenic aid by both the international society of sports nutrition (kerksick et al., 2018) and ioc (maughan et al., 2018), but its effects vary based on the physiological demands of the exercise task tested. for example, a meta-
analysis published in 2012 (hobson et al., 2012) 
found the most pronounced effects were observed in exercise tests lasting 1-4 minutes. as a proton 
buffer, the ergogenic effe cts of beta-alanine are 
most pronounced for ta sks requiring rapid atp 
production via anaerobic glycolysis, such as high-
intensity continuous or intermittent bouts lasting 
30 seconds to 10 minutes (maughan et al., 2018). based on the primary ergogenic mechanism, benefits could potentially be observed in programs with relatively high repetition ranges (outlaw et al., 2016) or short rest periods between sets, although it remains unclear if beta-alanine 
promotes hypertrophy. one study found the 
combination of creatine and beta-alanine improved resistance training-induced hypertrophy significantly more than a placebo or creatine alone (hoffman et al., 2006), whereas beta-
alanine failed to enhance increases in lean body mass in response to resistance training in other 
research (outlaw et al., 2016). nonetheless, it is 
possible that beta-alani ne could be used to 
improve training adaptations by promoting greater training volume throughout the course of a resistance training program (hoffman et al., 2008). competition preparation length of contest preparation 
unfavorable physiological adaptations to 
weight loss in lean athletes are related both to absolute body fat levels and the magnitude of acute relative energy deficiency. by manipulating the length of contest preparation (and, therefore, the rate of weight loss), the size of the energy deficit can be modified to influence the degree of acute 
 88 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
relative energy deficiency. for example, mero et al. (2010) investigated the effects of two different rates of weight loss in recreationally trained females on 
protein-matched (1.4 g/kg) diets. one group was 
assigned to lose 1 kg per week (with an energy deficit of 1100 kcal/day), while the other was assigned to lose 0.5 kg per week (with an energy deficit of 550 kcal/day). after the four-week intervention, the group with a faster rate of weight loss lost more weight and fat mass, but also 
experienced a significant reduction in testosterone 
and an increase in sex hormone binding globulin. garthe and colleagues (2011) studied two rates of weight loss in elite male and female athletes. one group was assigned to lose 0.7% of their body mass per week (with a 19% reduction in energy intake), while the other group was assigned to lose 1.4% 
per week (with a 30% reduction in energy intake). 
in order to standardize the total amount of weight lost, the slow group spent longer duration of time in the weight loss phase than the fast group (8.5 versus 5.3 weeks, respectively). both groups lost similar amounts of total body mass. however, the 
slow group lost significantly more fat mass than 
the fast group, and the slow group had a significant increase in lean mass while lean mass remained unchanged in the fast group. regardless of group, females gained lean mass during the intervention; males in the slow group gained lean mass, whereas males in the fast group tended to lose lean mass. 
furthermore, the slow weight loss group 
experienced more favorable changes in exercise performance. 
in recent years, a n umber of case r eports 
and small studies have documented contest preparation in male and female physique athletes. these studies have ranged from 14-32 weeks from 
the beginning of preparation to the first 
competition (halliday et al., 2016; kistler et al., 2014; pardue et al., 2017; robinson et al., 2015; rohrig et al., 2017; rossow et al., 2013; tinsley et al., 2019). the loss of fat-free mass is a common observation among male physique athletes; all of the previously mentioned male case reports 
documented some degree of fat-free mass loss, 
with some as high as 6.6 kg (kistler et al., 2014). of the data available, duration of contest preparation does not appear to clearly dictate the degree of fat-free mass loss, as similar (and fairly substantial) losses have been reported in contest preparation periods as short as 14 weeks (robinson et al., 2015) 
 
and up to 26 weeks (kistl er et al., 2014). it is 
difficult to determine ideal contest preparation duration using case reports, as the loss of fat-free 
mass is inevitably influenced by several factors, 
which include (but are not limited to) differences in overall weight loss, dietary approaches, resistance training approaches, volume of cardiovascular exercise, and genetic variability between individuals. nonetheless, chappell and colleagues (2018) noted that male competitors 
receiving high contest placings tended to 
implement a rate of weight loss of 0.46% of body mass per week, which was slower than the non-placers, who lost over 0.5% of body mass per week. in contrast, case reports documenting comparatively higher losses of fat-free mass implemented weight loss rates of 0.7% (kistler et 
al., 2014) and 1.0% (robinson et al., 2015) per week. 
as such, chappell and colleagues (2018) speculate that slower weight loss may lead to more favorable placements by facilitating retention of fat-free mass. in female case reports, lean mass has remained stable (halliday et al., 2016) or increased 
by up to 1.3 kg (rohrig et al., 2017) over the course 
of preparation, with rates of weight loss generally ranging from 0.4 to 0.75% of body mass per week. a larger study (hulmi et al., 2016) also found a slight increase in fat-free mass in female physique athletes (+0.4 kg, measured via dexa) over the course of contest preparation, with average 
duration of 19.8 weeks. wh ile research to date has 
not documented marked reductions in fat-free mass during contest preparation among females, unfavorable effects on performance, hormones, and menstrual status have been noted. such unfavorable outcomes highlight the importance of carefully managing the magnitude of energy 
deficiency, but it is difficult to draw conclusions 
about ideal preparation duration due to homogenous approaches in the literature. 
taken together, the limited data indicate 
that rate of weight loss is more physiologically relevant than the duration of contest preparation per se, and slower rates of weight loss ( ≤0.5% of 
body mass per week) are generally preferable for 
attenuating unfavorable adaptations to weight loss and losses of fat-free mass. retention of fat-free mass appears to be a more pressing concern in male competitors than female competitors, which may relate to greater overall reductions in body mass, more drastic changes in testosterone levels,

lower absolute and relative body fat percentage requirements for the male bodybuilding category, competitors being more experienced and closer to 
their genetic ceiling for muscle mass, and possibly 
additional factors. diet periodization 
while the rate of weight loss during 
contest preparation is often discussed as a linear weekly reduction in weight, the energy deficit is often applied in a nonlinear manner. previous 
research has shown that bodybuilders frequently 
implement refeeds (mitchell et al., 2017a) and cheat 
meals (chappell et al., 2018), which both represent 
transient elevations in caloric intake for a fixed amount of time. in addition, many studies have investigated the implementation of diet breaks , in 
which individuals on a weight loss diet 
temporarily revert to ad libitum, self-selected 
eating habits (keogh et al., 2014) or increase caloric intake to achieve neutral energy balance (byrne et al., 2018). carbohydrate restriction has the potential to reduce traini ng capacity (walberg et 
al., 1988), and intramuscular glycogen depletion 
has been shown to directly impair muscle function 
(ortenblad et al., 2013). as such, high carbohydrate refeeds and cheat meals (or cheat days) may confer transient positive effects on training quality during a prolonged energy deficit. cheat meals/days, refeeds, and diet breaks fall on a spectrum of 
nonlinear fat loss strategies, as presented in figure 
1. such strategies also offer a psychological 
reprieve from the restrictive dietary constraints 
imposed during a weight loss diet, allowing the competitor to enjoy foods that may be too high in carbohydrate or caloric content to be regularly incorporated into the diet. however, given the prevalence of binge eating episodes among 
physique athletes discussed in subsequent 
sections, the practice of unstructured cheat meals or cheat days may be contraindicated in many circumstances. aside from psychological factors, 
arguably the most intriguing application of nonlinear fat loss strategi es for physique athletes 
pertains to the potential to mitigate some of the 
unfavorable physiological adaptations that 
accompany weight loss. 
the physiological adaptations associated 
with contest preparation are related to both fat mass reduction and short-term energy availability. while fat mass reduction is a necessary goal of contest preparation, energy availability can be 
 
transiently manipulated. leptin is reduced after only days of energy restri ction (keim et al., 1998), 
long before significant fat loss has occurred. this 
initial drop relates to short-term energy 
availability, and is particularly influenced by carbohydrate restriction (jenkins et al., 1997). similarly, three days of overfeeding with high carbohydrate intake increased leptin by 28% and 24-hour energy expenditure by 7%, whereas a similar magnitude of overfeeding on a high fat diet 
did not (dirlewanger et al., 2000). however, this 
may not be practical for ph ysique athletes, as the 
40% energy surplus required to elicit the response 
may cause substantial fat accretion that would be only minimally offset by the 7% increase in energy expenditure. this incomplete compensation for high energy intake has also been observed directly 
in physique athletes (trexler et al., 2017); resting 
energy expenditure (ree) acutely increased in the period immediately follow ing competition, but the 
increase was small compared to the substantial increase in caloric intake. while these results suggest that implementing periods of neutral or 
positive energy expenditure may help mitigate 
unfavorable changes in hormone concentrations and energy expenditure during weight loss, such strategies must implement a conservative magnitude and duration of refeeding that does not oppose the overall progression of fat loss. it is also currently unknown how short of a period of 
maintenance calories would be needed to affect the 
metabolic rate. 
a recent study (byr ne et al., 2018) 
investigated the effects of two-week diet breaks on weight loss and energy expenditure. one group followed a continuous weight loss program for 16 weeks, whereas the other group alternated 
between two weeks of an energy deficit and two 
weeks of energy balance. both groups spent equal total weeks in an energy deficit of the same size. results indicated that the group implementing intermittent diet breaks lost more fat mass and total weight and experienced a smaller reduction in ree after correcting for body composition. 
overall, the strategy of implementing two-week 
periods of energy balance partially attenuated the anticipated drop in the metabolic rate, without requiring periods of posi tive energy balance. 
however, the overall weight loss process took approximately twice as long, which may be viewed as a prohibitively inconvenient trade-off by some 
 90 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
competitors. 
in an effort to minimize the inefficiency of 
nonlinear approaches, other studies have 
implemented diet breaks of shorter duration. in 
one instance, an 8-week study (keogh et al., 2014) evaluated one-week diet breaks implemented every other week. the continuous energy restriction group followed a 5500-kilojoule energy restriction each week of the study, whereas the intermittent group alternated between one week of 
5500-kilojoule energy restriction and one week of 
their usual diet. weight loss observed in the group with diet breaks was no t significantly different 
than the comparator group on a continuous weight loss diet, despite the differing magnitude of energy restriction. a different study (davoodi et al., 2014) implemented a protocol in which energy was 
restricted for 11 days, followed by a 3-day diet 
break. this two-week cycle was repeated three times, for six total weeks. the comparator group, in contrast, implemented continuous energy restriction for the entire six-week period. results showed that intermittent energy restriction with 3-
day diet breaks allowed for a similar degree of 
weight and fat loss, and attenuated reductions in the resting metabolic rate, despite higher average caloric intake throughout the intervention. 
the limited data available suggest 
implementation of nonlinear or intermittent energy restriction strategies, such as diet breaks 
and refeeds, may partially attenuate some of the 
unfavorable physiological adaptations to energy restriction, thereby imparting favorable effects on weight loss outcomes. ho wever, these strategies 
extend the timeline of the weight reduction process. as such, the ideal magnitude, duration, and timing of short-term caloric increases are not 
currently known. theoretica lly, the most efficient 
strategy would effectively in crease caloric intake in 
a sufficient magnitude and duration to offset physiological adaptations to weight loss, while minimizing the risk of fat accretion and the amount of overall time spent dieting. for a more extensive discussion of nonlinear weight loss strategies, 
readers are directed to the recent review by peos 
and colleagues (2019). peak week 
the final week prior to competition is 
commonly referred to as “peak week”. the overall goal of the peak week is to make muscles appear larger and more detailed by filling glycogen stores 
 
w h i l e m i n i m i z i n g s u b c u t a n e o u s w a t e r . a r e c e n t study on peaking practice s in bodybuilders found 
that 94 percent of competitors alter their nutritional 
approach during the peak week (chappell and 
simper, 2018). historically, this included approaches such as potassium loading, sodium restriction and water rest riction (kleiner et al., 
1990; shephard, 1994; steen, 1991), while more recent studies have observed a decline in practices such as sodium and water restriction, these 
approaches are still used by a significant number 
of competitors (chappell and simper, 2018). however, some or all of these approaches may be misguided in natural competitors, as there are at least theoretical roles for sodium, water and carbohydrate to enhance onstage appearance. carbohydrates 
one of the primary goals during the peak 
week is to enhance muscular fullness. each gram of glycogen can result in a minimum of 3-4 grams 
of stored water within muscle in a dehydrated state and up to 17 grams when carbohydrate loading is coupled with adequate hydration (fernandez-elias 
et al., 2015; olsson and saltin, 1970). practically, 
increasing carbohydrate consumption leading up to a competition should enhance the appearance of a physique. for example, one study observed an 
increase in bicep muscle thickness the day of the competition when competitors were loading carbohydrates (bamman et al., 1993). competitors 
likely do not gain muscle mass late in contest 
preparation (kistler et al., 2014; rossow et al., 2013); therefore, it is assumed this increase in 
muscle thickness was due to carbohydrate loading. 
a recent study of competitors found 83% 
did some form of carbohydrate loading during the final week prior to competition (chappell and 
simper, 2018). in practice, the pattern in which 
carbohydrates are loaded differs between competitors. some competitors front load (place their highest carbohydrate days early in the week) while others back load (place their highest 
carbohydrate days later in the week) ( figure 2 ). 
moreover, there is evidence that after 3 days of 
glycogen depletion, a large carbohydrate load can 
cause glycogen supercompensation where as much as 1.79 times initial glycogen can be stored in muscle (goforth et al., 1997). this may result in an even more full and extreme look onstage; therefore, this approach could be used by competitors in divisions that require a more

extreme look such as bodybuilding. however, competitors in all division s may benefit from some 
form of carbohydrate loading unless they are not 
lean enough, then they may want to either pick a 
later competition or continue to lose body fat throughout the final week rather than increasing carbohydrates. water 
body water is stored in compartments. 
approximately 2/3 of body water is intracellular 
whereas 1/3 is extracellula r. of the extracellular 
compartment, 20% is plasma and the other 80% is interstitial fluid. a common goal for physique athletes in the peak week is to minimize interstitial fluid. oftentimes this is done through reducing 
water intake (kleiner et al., 1990; shephard et al., 1994; steen et al., 1991); however, this can reduce 
muscle water content, resulting in a decrease in 
muscle size (costill et al., 1976). decreasing water intake also reduces blood volume and blood pressure which can make it more difficult for a c o m p e t i t o r t o i n c r e a s e b l o o d f l o w t o t h e d e s i r e d muscles prior to stepping onstage (during the 
“pumping up” process), which could result in sub-
optimal appearance to judges. anecdotally, some competitors think water is the cause of visual smoothing on show-day, yet in practice it is our collective anecdotal opinion that smoothness is typically the result of excess body fat or loading too many carbohydrates either in total, or too quickly. 
a 70 kg male can store approximately 500 g 
glycogen (roughly 100 g in liver and 400 g in muscle) (wasserman, 2009). during the transitional period whil e carbohydrates are being 
metabolized, and once glycogen stores are full, glucose can accumulate outside of the cell pulling water into the extracellular space. therefore, it is 
important that competitors load an appropriate 
number of carbohydrate s over an appropriate 
timeframe to fill muscle glycogen stores while also consuming ample water. sodium 
sodium is the primary extracellular solute. 
since water follows solutes, some competitors 
eliminate sodium in an attempt to reduce 
extracellular water (chappell and simper, 2018). however, plasma sodium is tightly regulated in the kidneys. for example, sodium excretion is 
significantly reduced when switching to an extremely low sodium diet (rogacz et al., 1990). therefore, removing sodium from the diet will not 
 
have a significant impact on extracellular fluid removal. sodium elimination may negatively impact a competitor’s look onstage since glucose is 
transported through a sodium-coupled transporter 
(schultz and curran, 1970), which could influence glycogen storage. sodium also impacts blood pressure which may affect a competitor’s ability to get a pump and subsequently affect transient muscle size and vascularity onstage (stachenfeld, 2008). due to sodium’s effects on blood pressure it 
may be advisable to increase sodium on the day of 
competition, prior to stepping onstage to increase muscle pump and vascularity in appropriate divisions. 
practical recommendations 
direct scientific research comparing 
peaking approaches in physique athletes is lacking. 
therefore, we are hesitant to give recommendations on peaking strategies. based on the current evidence, there is potential harm in reducing sodium, water, or carbohydrates, and almost all competitors ma nipulate these variables 
in the peak week. we therefore recommend not 
reducing any of these thre e nutritional variables. 
carbohydrate loading can be a viable option if the athlete is lean enough, but no comparisons between front- or back-loading exist to determine which is superior and in practice, this may differ between individuals. ultimately, we recommend testing peak week strategies, if an athlete has 
sufficient time, before their competition.

post-competition recovery 
while the physiological adaptations 
associated with contest preparation can be quite unfavorable, they are transient. reversing adaptations involves both correcting the short-term energy gap by transitioning from negative to 
positive energy balance, and restoring fat mass and 
fat-free mass lost during contest preparation. as 
for short-term energy balance, it is common for physique athletes to acutely, but abruptly increase caloric intake immediately following competition (mitchell et al., 2017a; trexler et al., 2017). merely transitioning from negative to positive energy 
balance is likely to have favorable effects on partial 
 restoration of the metabolic rate (trexler et al., 
2017) and hormones that are sensitive to short-term fluctuations in energy availability, such as leptin, ghrelin, and insulin (borer et al., 2009). however, full recovery of hormones and full reversal of adaptive energy expenditure suppression are 
likely to require some degree of fat mass and fat-
free mass restoration. 
at the end of a contest preparation diet, 
the physique athlete is physiologically primed for weight regain. as reviewed by maclean and colleagues (2011), such a physiological state is characterized by reduced energy expenditure and 
elevated hunger. due to the cyclical nature of 
 94 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes

weight gain and weight reduction associated with bodybuilding (mitchell et al., 2017a), competitors rarely attempt to maintain contest-level body fat 
percentages for an extended period of time. 
significant weight regain is typically observed within days of competition (trexler et al., 2017), 
and binge eating episodes are common within this time period (andersen et al., 1995). as such, studies have documented cases in which both male and female participants have regained up to 8 kg 
in the first 3-4 weeks following competition 
(lamar-hildebrand et al., 1989; mitchell et al., 2017a). however, there ar e potential drawbacks to 
approaches that favor rapid weight regain. rodent data suggest that overfeeding after sustained weight loss is accompanied by suppressed oxidation of dietary fat and adipocyte hyperplasia 
(jackman et al., 2008). as noted in a review by peos 
and colleagues (2019), the addition of new adipocytes results in a greater total capacity for fat storage, and yields smaller adipocytes that secrete less leptin and are more prone to energy storage. this propensity for adipocyte hyperplasia may 
therefore increase the likelihood of regaining more 
weight than was lost, which is known as body fat overshooting (saarni et al., 2006). in line with this hypothesis, there is evidence to suggest that athletes with repeated cycles of weight loss and regain tend to have a high er body mass index later 
in life (saarni et al., 2006), and it is quite common 
for humans to overshoot (saarni et al., 2006). 
furthermore, research in the general population suggests that the early phase of weight regain is characterized by preferential gain of fat mass (saarni et al., 2006), and research in competitive physique athletes has documented similar results (trexler et al., 2017). 
t h e t i m e c o u r s e o f w e i g h t r e s t o r a t i o n 
varies significantly in the literature. in some cases, physique athletes return to their baseline weight 
within nine weeks post-competition (tinsley et al., 2019), whereas others remain slightly below their baseline weight a full six months after competition (rossow et al., 2013). provided competitors 
maintain positive energy balance after competition 
and restore a large portion of the body mass lost, blood levels of ghrelin, thyroid hormones (t3 and t4), insulin, and cortisol generally approach baseline levels within 3-4 months following competition (hulmi et al., 2016; pardue et al., 2017; rossow et al., 2013). in the case of leptin (a body fat 
 
signal) (rossow et al., 2013) and testosterone (pardue et al., 2017; rossow et al., 2013), levels may not fully recover until 5-6 months post-
competition, but are generally trending to pre-
competition levels within this timeframe. when it comes to restoration of the menstrual cycle in female competitors that develop amenorrhea, an even longer recovery timeline may be required. the development of menstrual cycle irregularity (or complete cessation) is quite common in female 
competitors (hulmi et al., 2016), particularly in 
competitive classes that require a greater degree of leanness. unfortunately, efforts to reverse 
menstrual cycle irregularities often result in prolonged and highly variable recovery timelines. 
it seems prudent to advocate that 
physique athletes implement a rate of weight 
regain after competition that facilitates full 
recovery, but avoids deposition of excessive fat mass in the early phase of weight regain. within the first 1-2 months following competition, the athlete should aim to reach a sustainable and comfortable body weight; after this immediate 
phase of controlled weight restoration, they would 
then aim to restore their body fat percentage to their ideal off-season level and fully restore fat-free mass in a fairly linear manner over the subsequent 1-2 months, depending on the magnitude of weight that was lost. in this context, ideal off-season body composition refers to a sustainable body fat 
percentage that is conducive to normal endocrine 
status, facilitates lean mass accretion, mitigates the need for excessive weight loss for subsequent competitions, and resolves the hyperphagia experienced following competition. for individuals prone to excessively rapid weight regain, strategies to successfully manage 
controlled refeeding are likely similar to the 
strategies that facilitate successful weight loss maintenance. such strategi es include favoring high 
protein and high fiber intake, regular self-monitoring of body weight and caloric intake, reducing time spent in sedentary activities, maintaining a similar diet structure with low 
energy-density foods while avoiding highly 
palatable foods that could trigger overeating, and maintaining high levels of structured exercise; in essence, such competitors’ post-competition recovery diets would be qualitatively similar to their competition diets in composition and schedule, but higher in total calories and

macronutrients (melby et al., 2017). 
ultimately, complete recovery of 
physiological parameters is typically observed 4-6 
months following competition, provided the 
physique athlete maintains positive energy balance and regains a significant portion of the weight lost during the preparation period. it seems likely the timeline of recovery would be accelerated by consumption of a larger energy surplus and a more rapid weight regain. 
physiological adaptations 
there are several physiological 
adaptations that occur during contest preparation and recovery. in this section we will cover body composition, menstrual cycle, daily activity and sleep. body composition 
nearly all studies of male competitors 
observe a reduction in lean mass, while lean mass loss reported in female competitors is typically lower during contest preparation. for example, some studies of female competitors have observed either little lean mass loss during preparation 
(halliday et al., 2016; hulmi et al., 2016) or even a 
slight increase (petrizzo et al., 2017; rohrig et al., 
2017). the reason for this difference between sexes is unknown; however, it may be due to baseline testosterone levels being higher in males, making them more responsive to the large decline in testosterone that typicall y occurs during contest 
preparation. lean mass differences could also be 
due to the level of conditioning required in bodybuilders versus othe r physique classes. we 
cover physiological adaptations more fully in previous sections. menstrual cycle 
it was previously thought that 
reproductive function in women was regulated by 
body fat levels; however, there is increasing evidence that energy availability is the primary driver of reproductive function (loucks, 2003). 
energy availability is the difference between total 
energy intake and exercise energy expenditure relative to fat free mass. this difference is the 
energy available for physiological and metabolic 
processes like creating hormones and building bone (fagerberg, 2018). 
to prevent menstrual cycle abnormalities, 
female athletes are encouraged to consume at least 30 kcal/kg lean mass daily. energy intake below this amount may result in several hormone-related 
 
changes, including disruption of luteinizing hormone pulsatility. this can result in amenorrhea, a reduction in bone density and increased fracture 
risk (loucks et al., 2011). yet, to reach competitive 
l e v e l s o f b o d y f a t o n s t a g e , m a n y f e m a l e competitors may need to consume fewer than 30 kcal/kg lean mass at least at some stage during contest preparation. as a result, menstrual cycle abnormalities are widely reported in female competitors (elliot et al., 1987; haff et al., 2001; 
hulmi et al., 2016; kleiner et al., 1994; walberg-
rankin et al., 1993), which can persist into the post-competition period. for example, in a cohort of female competitors, 63% reported menstrual cycle abnormalities during contest preparation; 
however, 28% still reported abnormalities after a post-competition recovery period (mean length 
17.5 weeks) (hulmi et al., 2016). moreover, a drug-
free female figure competitor who reached 23.2 kcal/kg fat free mass daily during contest preparation did not have a normal menstrual cycle for 71 weeks following competition despite increasing caloric intake to >30 kcal/kg lean mass 
(halliday et al., 2016). 
taken together, these findings highlight 
the importance of taking an offseason between competitions, especially for female competitors. during the offseason, caloric intake should be increased to at least >30 kcal/kg lean mass daily. offseason duration should be long enough so that 
a female competitor regains their monthly cycle 
and has a normal cycle most of the offseason. daily activity / non-exercise activity thermogenesis (neat) 
total daily energy expenditure (tdee) is 
the sum of the basal metabolic rate, the thermic effect of food, exercise activity thermogenesis and 
non-exercise activity thermogenesis (neat). 
neat encompasses all non-exercise movement such as occupation-related activity, leisure-time activity and involuntary activities like postural control, twitching and fidgeting. energy expended from neat can vary up to 2,000 calories per day between individuals of simi lar size (levine, 2007). 
moreover, caloric expenditure from fidgeting can 
range from 100-800 calories daily (ravussin et al., 1986). due to this large variability, neat can play a significant role in energy balance. importantly, neat may decline while dieting (peos et al., 2019). in a cross-sectional study, obese participants who lost an average of 
 96 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
23% of their body weight had an 18% lower tdee than individuals who had never dieted. moreover, 71% of this difference was due to reductions in 
neat in response to dieting (weigle et al., 1988). 
in an interventional study, a 10% reduction in body weight resulted in an average reduction in neat of 262 calories/day, whereas a 20% reduction in body weight reduced neat by 500 calories/day on average in obese subjects. therefore, the amount of w e i g h t l o s t d u r i n g a d i e t m a y i m p a c t t h e 
magnitude of neat reduction (leibel et al., 1995). 
to date, there is not direct research on changes in neat in physique athletes. however, it is likely that competitors could experience a significant reduction (rossow et al., 2013). 
from a practical standpoint, tracking daily 
steps may help counteract reductions in neat 
during contest preparation. in fact, a meta-analysis 
on pedometer use and activity found individuals who track steps using a pedometer increase their step counts (bravata et al., 2007). however, we caution against competitors pushing to extremes in daily activity because there is evidence that tdee 
may not increase further at high levels of activity 
due to reductions in involuntary movement (pontzer et al., 2016). sleep 
it is recommended adults sleep 7-9  hours 
per night and achieve a sleep efficiency of 85% 
(time asleep in bed) to promote general health 
(hirshkowitz et al., 2015; ohayon et al., 2017). 
interestingly, athletes tend to sleep less (~6.5 
h/night) and their sleep quality is lower 
(hausswirth et al., 2014; l eeder et al., 2012). while 
sleep deprivation has a minimal effect on acute 
strength performance (fullaga r et al., 2015); it plays 
a role in decision making and mood, which could 
directly affect a physique athlete. there is also 
evidence that lack of sleep could compromise body 
fat loss or elevate lbm loss (nedeltcheva et al., 
2010). anecdotally, some ph ysique athletes tend to 
have sleep issues, but there is only one study 
measuring sleep in a bodybuilder (pardue et al., 
2017). during a 13-month period including contest 
preparation and recovery, sleep efficiency was 
reduced by a maximum of 3.6%. oddly, sleep 
duration increased 20% and sleep efficiency 
increased 8.9% in the contest preparation phase, 
likely because the subject started the study 
sleeping only ~6 hours per night (pardue et al., 
2017). there was also a tr end for subjective sleep 
 
quality to decrease in month 4 of contest preparation. overall, more data are needed with subjective and objective indices before definitive 
statements regarding the effect of contest 
preparation on sleep quality or quantity can be made. 
our recommendation for physique 
athletes is similar to that of other athletes: sleep in 
a dark environment with a comfortable 
temperature (use earplugs or eye masks if 
necessary), restrict me ntal, emotionally or 
physically demanding activities prior to bed, and 
use dim light for ~2 hours before bedtime (bonnar 
et al., 2018). physique athletes should aim for 8-9 
hours of sleep per night. there also appears to be 
large inter-individual response to the effects of 
reduced sleep, therefore larger studies are needed, 
especially in physique athletes (mcneil and st-
onge, 2017). 
psychosocial aspects of competitive physique sport 
because physique competitors are judged 
based on aesthetics rather than performance and 
the necessity of lowering body fat to essential 
levels, the risks of psychosocial distress (andersen et al., 1995), and developing eating and body image disorders (mitchell et al., 2017c) requires consideration. given the cross-sectional nature of most research in this area, and the multifaceted relationship between numerous factors with eating 
behavior, the underlying causes of distress are not 
fully understood. psychological distress is likely driven by three factors: 1) physiological adaptations to extreme dieting having biopsychosocial effects (kalm and semba, 2005), 2) a disproportionate number of individuals with a history of (or risk of developing) psychopathology 
participating in competition (mitchell et al., 2017b), 
and 3) monitoring behaviors secondary to achieving successful body composition changes such as regular self-weighing (pacanowski et al., 2015), nutrition tracking (levinson et al., 2017), and physique checking (shafr an et al., 2004). each 
factor may contribute to higher incidences of 
distress and body and eating disorders than is 
observed in other weight training populations (goldfield, 2009; goldfield et al., 2006; mangweth et al., 2001; mitchell et al., 2017b; walberg and johnston, 1991). thus, each factor is reviewed, and tentative best-practice guidelines are provided when possible.

psychological distress among physique athletes 
while some psychological benefits such as 
the perceived ability to take on new challenges 
(asridis et al., 2014) occur during contest 
preparation, negative effects manifest as well. in one male natural bodybuilding case study, mood disturbance initially decreased. however, one-month prior to competition, mood disturbance increased three-fold, then increased seven-fold relative to baseline immediately prior to 
competition, only returning to normal six months 
post-season (rossow et al., 2013). in part, psychological effects of contest preparation are biologically driven. for example, early research found that severe, prolonged, energy restriction increased irritability, introversion, enthusiasm and motivation (kalm and semba, 2005). 
these effects are partly physiologically 
mediated; subsequent work exposing healthy men to energy deprivation caused disturbed sleep, fatigue, and urges to consume sweet and savory food (nindl et al., 1997). among competitors, compensatory coping beha viors can manifest to 
control cravings, such as avoidance of social 
situations (asridis et al., 2014). hulmi and colleagues (2016) reported similar physiological signs in female competitors, as a 3 to 4 month post-competition period was required for most (but not all) hormone markers to return to baseline. in some phases, such as post-com petition weight regain, 
females may experience greater stress as they share 
parallel physiological responses with men, but may have higher tendencies to dislike their off-season physique possibly mediated by societal pressure (asridis et al., 2014; murray et al., 2016). 
indeed, contest preparation drives some 
psychological effects, but others linger months 
after competing. andersen and colleagues (1995) 
reported 81.5% of male bodybuilders were preoccupied with food, 46% engaged in binge eating, and 30-50% were angrier or more anxious post-competition. post-competition binge-eating is likely a normal hyperphagic response, whereby an extreme desire for food occurs after substantial 
weight loss (dulloo et al., 1997; weyer et al., 2000), 
with associated distress likely caused by weight regain conflicting with physique goals. 
non-biological factors also influence 
disordered eating. symptoms of depression and negative affect can contri bute to binge eating, as 
suggested by goldfield and colleagues (2006), who 
 
found competitive bodybuilders binge eat more than recreational bodybuilders, despite both reporting similar levels of dietary restraint 
(goldfield et al., 2006). this suggests a higher 
percentage of competitors have attitudes or traits that expose them to greater psychological consequences during contest preparation. indeed, five of the 16 male physique division competitors in a recent study reported a prior eating or body image disorder (lenzi et al., 2019), and in a 1991 
study 42% of female competitors used to be 
anorexic, 67% were terrified of becoming fat and 50% experienced uncontrollable urges to eat (walberg and johnston, 1991). some researchers argue binge eating an d other behaviors are 
exacerbated among bodybuilders who judge their self-worth largely on their ability to control their 
weight and shape (goldfield, 2009). since the 
1990’s, authors reported higher incidences of disordered eating behaviors, body image concerns, and full eating disorders in competitors of both sexes when compared to non-competitive weightlifters (goldfield 2009; goldfield et al., 2006; 
mangweth et al., 2001; mitchell et al., 2017b; 
walberg and johnston, 1991). recently, mitchell and colleagues (2017b) reported higher body image concerns in competitors compared to resistance training non-competitors in a meta-analysis, with symptoms associated with general anxiety, social physique anxiety, depression, 
neuroticism, perfectionism and inversely 
associated with self-concept and esteem. 
finally, one’s dietary restraint disposition 
can impact psychology. dietary restraint is subdivided into two types: rigid and flexible control (westenhoefer et al., 1999). rigid control is characterized by eating only diet foods, avoiding 
desired foods, fasting, highly disciplined calorie 
counting and avoiding “off limit” foods. while flexible control shares the aspect of restraint, it is marked by eating a vari ety of foods, modifying 
portions, and adjusting eating if earlier meals contained higher calorie items, and is generally considered more adaptive and sustainable 
(westenhoefer et al., 2013). rigid behaviors like 
fasting prospectively predict (agras and telch, 1998), and in cross-sectional research are linked, with binge eating among women with bulimia and binge eating disorder (masheb et al., 2011). in weight loss cohorts, ther e are links between rigid 
restraint and binge eating, shape/weight 
 98 nutritional recommendations for physique athletes 
journal of human kinetics - vo lume 71/2020 http://www.johk.pl 
overvaluation, body dissatisfaction, disinhibited eating, dichotomous thin king, depressive and 
anxiety symptoms, and poorer wellbeing 
(linardon, 2018; linardon and mitchell, 2017; 
smith et al., 1999; timko and perone, 2005; tylka et al., 2015; westenhoefer et al., 1999). in contrast, flexible restraint is linked with lowered disordered eating, body image concerns, body weight, and psychological distress (shearin et al., 1994; smith et al., 1999; westenhoefer et al., 1999, 2013) and 
increases in flexible control are associated with 
binge eating abstinence, greater weight loss in the course of therapy (blomquist and grilo 2011), and in one study, predicted long-term weight maintenance among women with obesity (teixeira et al., 2010). 
while flexible restraint may be more 
adaptive, adverse outcomes are occasionally 
associated with it (linardon and mitchell, 2017; timko and perone, 2005; tylka et al., 2015). this may stem from overlapping behaviors among categories of restraint, as surprisingly, flexible control is highly correlated with rigid control ( r’s > 
.50). this calls into question how separate these 
components are, suggesting promoting flexible control could unintentionally prompt rigid practices (timko and perone, 2005; westenhoefer et al., 2013). indeed, flexib le restraint is associated 
with positive outcomes only when its shared 
variance with rigid restraint is removed (linardon 
and mitchell, 2017; tylka et al., 2015). however, it 
is unclear how to distinctly prescribe flexible rather than rigid control to avoid potential harm (tylka et al., 2015). that said, a key factor may be black and white views of eating, which mediate the association between restrained eating and weight regain (palascha et al., 2015); as viewing foods in 
non-dichotomous terms is a shared aspect of 
intuitive eating, which has no restraint component at all (tylka and kroon van diest, 2013), and flexible control (westenhoefer et al., 1999). 
physique and dietary monitoring practices 
likely follow one’s restraint disposition, and thus carry potential to increa se risks. some authors 
speculate self-monitoring in all cases can 
exacerbate eating disorder symptoms (simpson and mazzeo, 2017). auth ors of several cross-
sectional studies report as sociations between self-
monitoring and binge eating , eating concerns, and 
shape/weight overvaluation in those with and without clinically significant eating disorders 
 
(linardon et al., 2019; linardon and messer, 2019; mountford et al., 2006; shafran et al., 2007; simpson and mazzeo 2017). furthermore, causal 
links between shape checking and body 
dissatisfaction exist in some (shafran et al., 2007), but not all (bailey and waller, 2017) experimental work. however, authors of two recent weight loss studies reported no significant differences in eating and body image disorder symptoms between those 
implementing self-monitoring or those not (jospe 
et al., 2018; steinberg et al., 2014). to explain this 
discrepancy, it may be th ese monitoring behaviors 
are detrimental only when performed rigidly (fairburn, 2008), or by individuals likely to implement them rigidly, such as those with clinical or subclinical eating disorders. mitigating harm 
given the increased likelihood of 
competitors already or previously having, or possibly carrying a predis position towards eating 
and body image distress, and the obligatory exposure to both the biological drive towards hyperphagia and some of the behaviors which can 
exacerbate disordered eating, we echo the 
recommendations of the recently published narrative review specifically on this topic by helms 
and colleagues (2019). table 1 below is reprinted 
here with permission which outlines 
recommendations in each “season” of competitive bodybuilding (helms et al., 2019). to summarize: 
in the preparation phase, slow to moderate weight 
loss rates rather than rapid, which are associated with eating and body image disorder symptoms (mitchell et al., 2017b), should be implemented; non black-and-white views of foods and adherence should be emphasized (palascha et al., 2015); and rather than high frequency physique checking, 
scheduled and coach-supervised physique 
assessment should occur as are performed in clinical eating disorder practice (fairburn, 2008). in the transition from preparation into the offseason, a tapered but intentional caloric surplus should be implemented with the goal of steady, but controlled weight 
regain, and the re-introduction of internal rather 
than externally-cued nutr ition regulation should 
occur to facilitate a gradual return to non-restrained eating (e.g. hunger and satiety mediated portion control rather than food weighing and calorie tracking). 
finally, similar to the standard personal

training practice of screening physical health (craig and eickhoff-shemek, 2015), coaches should enlist the aid of nutrition and mental health care 
professionals (psychologists , therapists, registered 
dietitians) to screen the me ntal health of athletes 
prior to beginning contest preparation to ensure they are fully informed of risks, and have the appropriate mental health care professionals available to them. 
 
 
 
conclusion 
in conclusion, there are a myriad of factors to 
consider for physique athletes in contest 
preparation periods as well as the post-
competition period transitioning into the off-season. having a structured plan based on the factors within this article is recommended, but additional study of physique athletes is needed to provide more specific guidelines.

nutritional strategies of high level natural
bodybuilders during competition
preparation
a. j. chappell*, t. simper and m. e. barker
abstract
background: competitive bodybuilders employ a combination of resistance training, cardiovascular exercise,
calorie reduction, supplementation regimes and peaking strategies in order to lose fat mass and maintain fat free
mass. although recommendations exist for contest preparation, applied research is limited and data on the contest
preparation regimes of bodybuilders are restricted to case studies or small cohorts. moreover, the influence of
different nutritional strategies on competitive outcome is unknown.
methods: fifty-one competitors (35 male and 16 female) volunteered to take part in this project. the british natural
bodybuilding federation (bnbf) runs an annual national competition for high level bodybuilders; competitors must
qualify by winning at a qualifying events or may be invited at the judge ’s discretion. competitors are subject to
stringent drug testing and have to undergo a polygraph test. study of this cohort provides an opportunity to
examine the dietary practices of high level natural bodybuilders. we report the results of a cross-sectional study of
bodybuilders competing at the bnbf finals. volunteers completed a 34-item questionnaire assessing diet at three
time points. at each time point participants recorded food intake over a 24-h period in grams and/or portions.
competitors were categorised according to contest placing. a “placed ”competitor finished in the top 5, and a
“non-placed ”(dnp) competitor finished outside the top 5. nutrient analysis was performed using nutritics software.
repeated measures anova and effect sizes (cohen ’sd) were used to test if nutrient intake changed over time and
if placing was associated with intake.
results: mean preparation time for a competitor was 22 ± 9 weeks. nutrient intake of bodybuilders reflected a
high-protein, high-carbohydrate, low-fat diet. total carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes decreased over time in
both male and female cohorts ( p< 0.05). placed male competitors had a greater carbohydrate intake at the start of
contest preparation (5.1 vs 3.7 g/kg bw) than dnp competitors ( d= 1.02, 95% ci [0.22, 1.80]).
conclusions: greater carbohydrate intake in the placed competitors could theoretically have contributed towards
greater maintenance of muscle mass during competition preparation compared to dnp competitors. these findings
require corroboration, but will likely be of interest to bodybuilders and coaches.

doi 10.1186/s12970-018-0209-zbackground
in competitive bodybuilding, athletes are judged on their
muscularity (muscle size), conditioning (the absence of
body fat) and symmetry (muscular proportion). in order
to achieve the required physique, athletes undertake fat
loss regimes, whilst attempting to maintain lean body
mass (lbm) accrued prior to the fat loss period [1, 2].
athletes and their coaches use a combination of resist-
ance training, cardiovascular exercise, calorie restriction,
supplementation and peaking strategies in order to
obtain a competition-ready physique . bodybuilders
preparing for competition usually follow self- or coach-
prescribed diets, which often are comprised of a limited
and repetitive food regime, with the sole aim of supply-
ing specific amounts of protein, fat and carbohydrate
[3–8]. following these stringent dietary approaches is
common practice and connects with the notion of being
“hardcore ”celebrated amongst bodybuilders . al-
though broad recommendations exist for both nutrient
intakes and exercise prescription [10 –12], these recom-
mendations are theoretical, imprecise, and open to inter-
pretation. there is also a paucity of applied research on
high level bodybuilders.
recently a meta-analytic study combined 18 separate
studies on the dietary intake of bodybuilders . this
study reported that male competitors consumed on aver-
age 3292 kcal per day during contest preparation, with
52% of that energy coming from carbohydrate, 28% from
protein, and 22% from fat. female competitors by way of
comparison consumed 1739 kcal per day with 59% en-
ergy from carbohydrate, 28% energy from protein and
12% energy from fat. although the meta-analysis incor-
porated 385 participants, the majority of the studies
were published in the 1980s and 1990s and were non-
specific about participants ’phase of training, which may
be ‘off-season ’(prior to beginning contest preparation),
during contest preparation (often a period of 8 –24 weeks
before competition), or 1 week from competition (the
immediate pre-contest or peaking phase). the frequent
use of androgenic anabolic steroids (aas) amongst com-
petitive bodybuilders also confounds identification of op-
timal nutritional strategies and training regimes. indeed
one third of the studies included in the meta-analysis
reported aas use by athletes . furthermore, the
practices employed by athletes in the new physique cat-
egories, such as men ’s physique, figure/ athletic, sports/
fitness and swimsuit/bikini, which emphasize beauty ra-
ther than muscularity have not been scrutinised. more-
over, the lack of scrutiny of the practices employed
within the aforementioned divisions may mislead body-
builders as to what are the most effective strategies for
competitive bodybuilding.
within the united kingdom (uk), the british natural
bodybuilding federation (bnbf) runs nine regionalqualifying competitions; the regional qualifiers culminate
in a uk final championship, where the overall winner is
awarded professional status. this cohort provides an ex-
cellent opportunity to study the nutritional practices of a
high level group of natural bodybuilders. the strategies
employed by the most successful natural bodybuilders
can be compared to recommendations , which in-
clude protein intake of between 2.3 and 3.1 g/kg of
lbm, fat intake of 15 to 30% of total calories, with the
remaining calories from carbohydrate and a weekly
weight loss of 0.5 to 1% of bodyweight (bw) . here
we report the results of a recent cross-sectional study in-
vestigating the nutritional strategies of natural body-
building competitors at the bnbf finals.
methods
design
both male and female bodybuilders participating in the
bnbf finals were included in the study. all competitors
qualified for the uk final competition by winning their re-
spective weight or age class at a regional qualifying event
or were invited at the judge ’s discretion; providing they
had also been placed in the top three of their weight/ age
category. all qualifying class winners were subject to drug
testing based on urine analysis; targeted drug testing of
other non-placed athletes was also carried out. further-
more, all class winners at the final bnbf final were subject
to the same drug testing criteria, and all competitors
signed a waiver declaring their compliance with the world
anti-doping agency code [14, 15]. a certified wada la-
boratory (the sports medicine research and testing la-
boratory, salt lake city, usa) carried out all drug testing.
a qualified polygrapher polygraphed all competitors prior
to taking part in the competition as an additional method
to verify natural status.
the study was advertised via the bnbf social media
page, and registered competitors were recruited in per-
son by the first author at the outset of the uk finals. all
potential participants were fully informed of the study
aims and methods via a participant information sheet;
those agreeing to participate provided written informed
consent. participants then completed a 34-item ques-
tionnaire (see additional file 1). the questionnaire in-
quired about dietary and training habits, and body
weight change at three time points throughout contest
preparation (start, middle and end). participants retro-
spectively recorded their typical food intake over a 24-h
period in grams and/or portions. missing questionnaire
data and clarification about foods consumed/portions
were followed up via email. the questionnaire also in-
cluded items relating to the regular use of a coach, and
“cheat meal ”consumption. a “cheat meal ”, is when
competitors veer from their self- or coach-prescribed
diet. refeeds are strategies where competitors consumechappell et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2018) 15:4 page 2 of 12a known amount of energy in addition to their pre-
scribed dietary intake, in the belief that it increases
metabolic rate based on information from popular mag-
azines and websites .
results are reported separately for the male and fe-
male cohort as well as for participants who placed in
the top 5 (placed) and those who were placed out of

male competitors were from the bodybuilding cat-
egory, while the female competitors were recruited
from the bodybuilding, athletic and figure classes.
both the athletic and figure class emphasises less
muscularity than female bodybuilding, with bodyfat
levels distinguishing the two categories: lower (ath-
letic) or higher (figure) bodyfat.

to taking part in the competition) bodyweights. total
weight loss and percentage weight loss were calculated
as the difference between the start and end body weight.
body mass index (bmi) (kg/m2) was calculated from
self-reported height and end body weight, body fat per-
centage (bf%) and method used to estimate was based
on self-reported accounts. only competitors who re-
ported a bf% measured using callipers ( n= 9) were in-
cluded in the calculation of mean bf% and fat free mass
index (ffmi) . the ffmi was calculated based on
the estimated fat free mass (ffm) at the end point of
the contest preparation and expressed as kg/m2,.
dietary analysis
nutritional analysis of contest diets was performed using
the nutritics nutrition analysis software (version 4.267
academic edition, nutritics, dublin, ireland). macronu-
trient intake in grams per kg of bodyweight per day (g/
kg bw) and energy intake in kilocalories per kg of body-
weight (kcal/kg bw) was calculated for the start and end
of the diet period, based on competitors ’self-reported
bodyweight. macronutrients from dietary supplements
were included in the analysis based on manufacturer ’s
specifications from brand websites. the mean number of
food items consumed by a competitor at each phase of
preparation was counted. the percentage of the diet
made up of specific food groups was based on the euro-
pean food safety agency food classification system for
dietary reporting . any food group making up less
than 1% of the dietary intake was placed in the other in-
gredients category. beverages, including water, teas and
coffees were excluded from the food group analysis.
consumption of sugary soft drinks was not reported by
any competitor and so do not feature in this analysis.supplements
supplements were split into 12 different categories
reflecting those most commonly utilised by competitors:
“multivitamin ”,“vitamin c ”,“vitamin d ”,“mineral or
joint supplement ”,“omega 3 ”,“pre-workout ”,“protein
powder ”,“branch chain amino acids (bcaa) ”,“creat-
ine supplement (either directly or part of another sup-
plement) ”,“individual amino ”,“fat burners ”and
“miscellaneous ”(supplements used too infrequently to
be awarded their own category).
statistical analysis
data analysis was performed using the statistical analysis
package ibm spss (version 24). successful bodybuilders
(placed) and unsuccessful bodybuilders (dnp) were
compared for dietary intake (total energy intake (kcal
per day), and total nutrient intake (g per day), using a re-
peated measures analysis of variance (anova). energy
and nutrient intake adjusted for bodyweight (kcal/kg
bw; g/kg bw) was log-transformed to account for
skewed data and was then analysed by repeated mea-
sures anova. the effect of time, contest place and
time ⨯contest place was examined. mauchly ’s test of
sphericity was applied to data to examine if sphericity
was violated and if this was the case the greenhouse-
geisser estimate was utilised. for ease of interpretation
we report the data as energy and nutrient intake ad-
justed for bodyweight. hypothesis testing for categorical
variables was performed using a pearson chi-square for:
contest outcome (placed and dnp), use of coaching and
consumption of “cheat meals ”. independent t-tests
were used to identify if contest outcome (placed and
dnp) was related to: i) years training, ii) years compet-
ing, iii) starting weight, iv) end weight, v) weight loss, vi)
% weight loss, vii) weeks dieting, viii) weight loss per
week, ix) caffeine intake, x) number of meals, and xi)
fluid intake. statistical significance was declared where
p< 0.05 and the null hypothesis was rejected. cohen ’sd
practical significance was calculated for the effect of
contest outcome (placed and dnp) on energy and
macronutrient intakes for male bodybuilders (as opposed
to the multiple female competitive classes) for g/kg bw,
and kcal/kg bw. pooled standard deviations were used
to calculate cohen ’sdand effect sizes were multiplied
by an adjustment factor 0.975, to correct for bias to pro-
duce d. effect size cut-offs were defined as 0.2, 0.5, and
0.8 for small, medium and large effect sizes respectively.
results
participant characteristics
fifty-one bodybuilders (35 male, 16 female) participating
in the bnbf finals volunteered for the study, comprising
just over a third of the competition entrants ( n= 143).
all male competitors were from the bodybuildingchappell et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2018) 15:4 page 3 of 12category, while female competitors were from 3 separate
categories: bodybuilding ( n= 3), figure ( n= 9) and ath-
letic ( n= 4). the female categories were pooled for ana-
lysis. one male competitor was excluded due to failing
the pre-competition polygraph. the cohort included 6
competitors who had competed in a world amateur
championship (4 of whom were former world amateur
champions). the cohort also included 4 competitors
who had previously placed at a bnbf uk final, 3 com-
petitors who had won a regional overall bnbf title and
14 who had previously won a class at a bnbf regional
qualifier. complete dietary and training information was
available for 32 male and 15 female competitors.
the majority of the competitors (66.7% men, and
88.0% women) used a coach for guidance with training,
nutrition, posing and feedback on their physique. male
competitors who were placed did not differ from those
dnp in use of a coach (60.0% versus 59.1% respectively)
(χ2(1) 0.550, p= 0.46). there was also no difference ( χ2
(1) 0.163, p= 0.69) in the employment of a coach
amongst female competitors who placed (100.0%) and
dnp (78.0%). participant characteristics, including age,
years training and competing, bodyweight at the start of
contest preparation and length of time following a diet
are presented in table 1.
body composition estimation
ten male and 5 female competitors provided a self-
reported bf% along with the method they used to esti-
mate/calculate it. skin callipers were the most popular
method of assessment with 53% of competitors (5 male
and 4 female) using this method. thirteen percent of
competitors estimated bf% by looking in the mirror,
while the method employed by the remaining 34% wasnot stated. competitors did not specifically report
whether a trained professional performed the skin calli-
per tests. an estimate of ffmi was calculated for male
and female competitors who reported bf% measured by
callipers. the estimated ffmi for placed males was
22.74 ± 2.55 kg/m2, with two competitors exceeding
25.0 kg/m2. in female competitors, the mean estimated
ffmi was 18.1 ± 1.95 kg/m2.
dietary intake
macronutrients, and diet diversity
the mean macronutrient and energy intakes reported as
g/kg bw and kcal/kg bw at the start and end of contest
preparation are presented in table 2. macronutrient and
energy intakes presented as medians and interquartile
ranges, are provided as an additional file (see add-
itional file 2). analysis of log-transformed energy and
nutrient intake adjusted for bodyweight indicated no sig-
nificant difference in protein, carbohydrate, fat and en-
ergy intakes between placed and dnp competitors.
amongst both male and female competitors there was a
significant decrease in energy intake over time (male
p< 0.001, female p= 0.01), while there was also a non-
significant decrease in carbohydrate intake over time
amongst male competitors ( p= 0.054). results of the
cohen ’sdadjusted effect size testing for macronutrient
and energy intake scaled to bodyweight indicated a small
to medium effect on competitive outcome for g/kg bw
protein, in male competitors who placed compared to
dnp ( d= start 0.49, 95% ci [ −0.25, 1.30], end 0.60, 95%
ci [−0.15, 1.37]). a similar outcome was noted for
carbohydrate intake between males who placed and
dnp ( d= start 1.02, 95% ci [0.22, 1.80], end 0.35, [ −
0.40, 1.10]). small effect sizes were noted for both fat as

mean macronutrient and energy intakes reported as
total g per day and kcal per day for the start, middle and
end of contest preparation are presented in table 3.
total carbohydrate, fat and energy intakes significantly
declined over time ( p< 0.05) in both the female and
male groups, while there was a non-significant decrease
in protein intake ( p= 0.09) amongst male competitors.
the mean number of food items consumed by male
competitors was: start 11.5 ± 3.6, middle 9.7 ± 4.7, and
end 10.0 ± 3.5. amongst female competitors the mean
number of food items consumed was: start 12.3 ± 3.4,
middle 13.2 ± 4.0, and end 10.6 ± 3.9. the contribution
of different food groups to the competitors ’diets is pre-
sented in table 4. no competitor reported consuming
composite diet dishes, food imitates (meat and dairy al-
ternatives), sugar sweetened beverages or alcohol at any
time point during their preparation.
competitors frequently used supplements over the
course of contest preparation; these data are presented
in table 5. the consumption of caffeine, fluids and
number of meals a competitor consumed were com-
pared between placed and dnp competitors. there was
no statistically significant difference (t (25) = 0.51, p=
0.62) in daily caffeine consumption between males who
placed (360 ± 198 mg) and dnp (283 ± 153 mg). there
was also no difference (t (13) = 0.80, p= 0.44) in daily
caffeine consumption between females who placed (277
± 158 mg) and dnp (232 ± 173 mg). mean daily caffeine
consumption was 322 ± 176 (range 0 to 1384 mg) and
252 ± 161 (range 0 to 618 mg) mg per day for males and
females respectively. fluid intake for males who placed
and dnp place was 4.5 ± 1.7 and 4.5 ± 1.6 l per day, with
no difference between the groups (t (31) = 0.90, p=
0.37). in females the fluid consumption was 4.4 ± 2.3 and3.8 ± 1.1 l per day, with no significant difference between
the two groups (t (14) = 0.61, p= 0.55). mean consump-
tion of fluids for males and females was 4.5 ± 1.6 and
4.1 ± 1.7 l per day respectively.
the number of daily meals consumed by competitors
was counted, there was a trend ( χ2(5) 2.40, p= 0.10) for
males who placed to consume more meals per day than
those who dnp , 6.5 ± 0.9 vs 5.9 ± 1.1 respectively. there
was no significant difference ( χ2(2) 0.93, p= 0.23) in the
number of meals consumed per day between females who
placed and dnp , (6.1 ± 0.7 vs 6.7 ± 0.8). the mean number
of meals consumed per day was 6.2 ± 1.0 and 6.4 ± 0.8 for
male and females respectively. of the 32 male competi-
tors, 10 (31.2%) reported the consumption of “cheat
meals ”.“cheat meal ”consumption was less common
amongst placed competitors with only 3 (20.0%) stating
they used “cheat meals ”, while 7 (38.0%) of dnp competi-
tors reported consuming a “cheat meal ”. a single placed
competitor (5.0%) reported utilising a refeed strategy.
there was no difference in “cheat meal ”consumption be-
tween males who placed and dnp ( χ2(2) 2.82, p=0 . 2 8 ) .
of the 16 female competitors, 8 (50.0%) consumed a
“cheat meal ”during contest preparation. reports of
“cheat meal ”consumption were less frequent amongst
competitors who placed, 1 (6.3%) compared to those who
dnp , 3 (18.8%), while 1 placed (6.3%) competitor and 3
dnp (18.8%) competitors specified employing refeed
strategies. however there was no significant difference be-
tween the groups ( χ2(2) 2.62, p=0 . 1 9 ) .
discussion
this study is novel in providing insight on the nutri-
tional strategies of high-level competitive natural
bodybuilders. although other studies have claimed to
recruit high-level or elite natural bodybuilders, their
definition of elite has been less stringent than the
present investigation [3, 5]. we found no significant
difference in dietary intake between the placed andtable 2 macronutrient (g/kg bw) and energy intake (kcal/kg bw) of competitive bodybuilders during contest preparation: mean

of practical significance testing suggest carbohydrate
consumption in the early stages of contest prepar-
ation may influence competitive outcome in the male
bodybuilders. we also report that high level natural
bodybuilders consume more en ergy, particularly from
carbohydrate than previous accounts of natural body-
builders [3 –8]. as bodybuilders approached competi-
tion, energy intake is reduced primarily through a
reduction in carbohydrate and fat intake, with protein
intake remaining constant throughout contest prepar-
ation. accounts of body composition measurement
show that bodybuilders often employ subjective
methods to estimate bf% . finally, we report on
supplement and caffeine intake and note high con-
sumption compared to publicly prescribed safety rec-
ommendations for caffeine.body composition and the fat free mass index
skin callipers were the most commonly used methods
for estimating bf% amongst competitors, while subject-
ive methods based on appearance were also reported.
objective measurements of bf% from competitive body-
builders have been reported previously; these data sug-
gest ranges from 4.1 to 10.9% and 8.6 to 11.3% in males
and females respectively [2, 6 –8, 19 –21]. interestingly in a
sport concerned with achieving a low body fat, the majority
of competitors did not report bf%, with a proportion using
visual methods to estimate bf%. it is possible that the lack
of reporting of bf% may reflect a greater emphasis placed
on the appearance of low body fat in bodybuilding rather
than objectively obtained measures.
a ffmi above 25 kg/m2is suggested as an upper limit
for muscle accretion, without the use of aas . this
threshold, however, is based on photographic estimatestable 3 total macronutrient intake of competitive bodybuilders during contest preparation: mean daily intake with standard

measurement of 157 gymnasium users so should be
interpreted with some caution . we provided an esti-
mate of the mean ffmi based on competitors who re-
ported bf% using callipers of 22.7 kg/m2, this is higher
than the 21.8 kg/m2reported in the study of gymnasium
users . interestingly, two male competitors in this
study had a ffmi above the 25 kg/m2, (25.73 and
25.15 kg/m2) natural threshold based on the pre 1959
mr. america winners. we did not measure ffm or bf%
directly and we acknowledge the limitations of self-
reported accounts of bf%; however, it is not inconceiv-
able that there are high-level natural bodybuilders whoexceed this theoretical ffmi 25.0 kg/m2threshold. the
mean ffmi of 18.1 kg/m2reported in females was in
agreement with previous estimates of 18.3 kg/m2.
but greater than that of a recent case report . no
ffmi upper threshold has been proposed for females;
however, a ffmi between 19.0 to 20.0 kg/m2seems a
reasonable objective starting point based on estimates of
female populations .
dietary intake
energy intake
as expected energy intake of male and female competitors
was higher at the start of contest preparation compared to
the end. similar findings have been reported in previous
observations [13, 23, 24]. competitors reported reducing
energy intake in stages over the course of their prepar-
ation with smaller differences from the start to the middle
and middle to end of the diet. similar strategies involving
modest reductions in carbohydrate and fat consumption
to facilitate weight loss has been reported elsewhere .
in contrast, two case studies of bodybuilders [5, 7] re-
ported a reduction in energy intake between 882 to
1300 kcal/d from the start to the end of the competition
preparation, compared to smaller reductions (554 kcal/d)
in our placed males. smaller reductions are intended to
counteract metabolic adaptations to dieting, changes in
energy requirements and preservation of lbm . both
male and female competitors reported a high meal fre-
quency. this may reflect the practical aspects of consum-
ing large volumes of food combined with and belief that
multiple meals may preserve more lbm, while contribut-
ing to greater appetite control [25 –27].
research indicates greater lbm preservation and exer-
cise performance with slower versus faster weight loss, a
0.5 to 1% of bw per week is recommended for natural
bodybuilding [10, 28]. our cohort reporting dieting for on

son et al. , and 26 weeks in both rossow et al. and
kister et al. studies. the weekly weight loss in the
present study was estimated to be 0.46% per week in the
placed males, compared to 0.5 , 0.7 and 1.0% in
case studies. fascinatingly, petrizzo et al. recently ad-
vocated weight loss of 0.5% bw per week for lbm preser-
vation during natural bodybuilding contest preparation. in
the present investigation, weight loss was 0.46% per week
reflecting this recommendation; it seems likely that slower
weight lost in our placed males may have resulted in
greater preservation of lbm than the dnp males.
macronutrients
carbohydrate
carbohydrate was the most abundant macronutrient con-
sumed across all the phases of the diet, in both male and
female competitors. the majority of carbohydrates came
from cereals, tubers, fruit, and vegetables. confectionary
items, such as sweets and water-based desserts, legumes
and bread were consumed sparingly during contest prepa-
rations in agreement with previous accounts of bodybuild-
ing menus [5, 7, 29]. carbohydrate intake was reduced
from the start to the end of contest preparation reflecting
the practice seen in bodybuilding case studies [3 –5].
carbohydrate intake amongst placed males (5.1 g/kg bw)
was similar to a meta-analysis of contest preparation
bodybuilders (4.9 g/kg bw) . however, intake was
higher amongst placed male competitors in the weeks pre-
ceding the competition (end of the diet), 4.6 g/kg bw
compared to previous reports (3.8 g/kg bw) . intake
was also higher for male competitors compared to three
recent case studies, where mean intakes were between 2.5
to 3.0 g/kg bw over 26 and 28 weeks [3, 4], and 1.2 to
1.4 g/kg bw over 14 weeks .
carbohydrate energy in the female cohort (placed and
dnp start of diet: 3.7 and 4.0 g/kg bw), was higher than
two case studies (3.4 g/kg bw and 1.5 to 1.9 g/kg
bw ) and a meta-analysis conducted on studies
reporting intake amongst female bodybuilders over
30 years ago (3.1 g/ kg bw) . higher intakes have
been reported in a recent case report of a dieting female
physique competitor where intake was initially 5.0 g/kg
bw before decreasing to 1.8 g/kg bw by the end of
the 6 month study period. intakes of 5.0 g/kg bw have
been reported in the final week of contest preparation,
 which may reflect carbohydrate loading strategies in
the final week of competition.
carbohydrate intake amongst the placed males (4.6 to
5.1 g/kg bw) was in line with previous recommenda-
tions of 4 –7 g/kg bw for bodybuilders aiming to main-
tain weight . cohens deffect size testing indicated
carbohydrate intake at the start of the diet may have
some impact on competitive outcome. placed malesconsumed 1.0 to 1.4 g/kg bw more carbohydrate than
those who dnp during this period. this equates to an
additional 75 to 97.5 g carbohydrate (281.2 to 365.6 kcal)
per day in a 75 kg male. this additional carbohydrate is
a non-trivial amount as even modest resistance training
protocols can deplete muscle glycogen concentrations
between 24 to 82% [31, 32]. furthermore, as little as
15 g of carbohydrate consumed during resistance train-
ing may increase performance in hypertrophy rep ranges
. finally, the effect of isometric contractions on
bodybuilders ’muscle glycogen concentrations should be
considered. bodybuilders routinely hold isometric con-
tractions for between 6 to 60s for 10 to 30 min in prep-
aration for competition . by way of comparison
10 min of isometric exercise at 20% of maximum volun-
tary contraction for 10 s, with 10 s rest intervals can se-
verely deplete muscle glycogen in type 1 fibres . an
adequate carbohydrate intake during contest preparation
to maintain muscle glycogen should therefore be an im-
portant consideration for the natural bodybuilder.
low carbohydrate diets are effective for weight loss,
however they may result in a disproportionate loss of
lbm [35 –38]. an example of this can be seen in the
study by robinson et al. where the athletes lost 43%
of their lbm following a low carbohydrate diet. while
higher carbohydrate diets utilised by other bodybuilding
case studies resulted in smaller lbm loss, 21% and 32%
[3, 4]. multiple factors could have contribute to the
lbm loss seen in robinson et al. , however recent cri-
tiques have suggested more prudent dietary strategies
should be employed for natural bodybuilding [7, 39].
interestingly, the two female athletes involved in the
petzzaro et al. and rohrig et al. case reports in-
creased lbm and reduced fat mass in despite following
a similar dietary approach to robinson et al. . with
the exception of a case report which tracked the body
composition of 6 physique athletes (4 male, 2 female)
using aas increases in lbm and a reductions in fat
mass amongst bodybuilders during contest preparations
have been previously unreported [1, 3 –6, 21, 41 –43]. in
spite of this finding evidently, there may be a threshold
for carbohydrate intake, after which there is an increase
in the rate of lbm loss regardless of protein intake or
resistance training.
protein
protein constituted between 32.0 to 40.0% of total energy
in both male and female competitor ’s diets in the present
study in line with previously reported data . the main
protein sources were from dairy, white meat, nuts and sea-
food in agreement with data from previous bodybuilding
studies [5, 6, 29]. the high intake of protein from dairy re-
flects the prominence of protein powder in competitors ’
diets. red meat and eggs were consumed to a lesser extentchappell et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2018) 15:4 page 8 of 12than the aforementioned foods options. protein intakes
were between 2.7 g/kg bw and 3.3 g/kg bw amongst
male and female competitors, similar to reports from case
studies 2.2 to 3.5 g/kg bw [3 –8].
the prioritisation of protein over other macronutri-
ents during energy restriction is common practice
amongst bodybuilders [3 –8, 40]. high protein diets are
known to spare lbm during energy deficits [43 –46],
maintain nitrogen balance and stimulate muscle protein
synthesis (mps) . protein is also satiating, which
may improve dietary adherence during energy restriction
. protein digestion is also known to have the greatest
thermic effect of the three macronutrients. approxi-
mately 20 to 30% of net energy is lost through dietary
thermogenesis of protein (compared to around 3% for
fat); this extra thermic effect may contribute to add-
itional weight loss [36, 45].
protein intake recommendations for strength-trained
athletes during energy restriction are 2.0 g/kg bw, with
0.25 to 0.3 g/kg bw during the early recovery phase
after exercise . however, a recent systematic review
has recommended higher levels of between 2.3 to 3.1 g/kg
bw of lbm during severe calorie restriction , al-
though this recommendation was based on only two em-
pirical studies [36, 43]. nevertheless it seems likely that
protein intake amongst the competitors in this study was
adequate for the preservation of lbm. this additional
protein may be advantageous exploiting the thermic
effect of food and satiation offered by additional pro-
tein. however, a recent experimental study found that
additional protein energy was not realised in changes
in body composition [37, 50].
fat
fat intake was the lowest amongst the three macronutri-
ents, and like carbohydrate was reduced over time in
favour of maintaining protein. there was a tendency for
competitors in this cohort to favour low-fat diets. food
selection patterns emphasised this with oils and red and
processed meats making up only a small percentage of
the cohort ’s overall diet. although eggs were commonly
consumed, the yolks were routinely discarded. nuts and
seeds, along with white meats, marine and cereals were
the most prominent sources of fat in the athletes ’diet.
moreover, many athletes reported consuming an omega-
3 fatty acid supplement, suggesting athletes favouring a
diet higher in mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids ra-
ther than saturates. low fat food selection patterns have
previously been reported .
the fat intakes recorded in the present study (start of
diet: males 0.8 g/kg bw, females 0.8 g/kg bw) were simi-
lar to previous accounts reported by spendlove et al. 
for male (0.95 g/ kg bw) but higher than previous reports
of female competitive bodybuilders (0.32 g / kg bw).despite the seemingly low fat intake accounts as low as
8% of energy have been reported in the bodybuilding lit-
erature [51, 52]. bodybuilder ’s in the present study placed
nutrients in a hierarchy, prioritising protein followed by
carbohydrate for the aforementioned reasons. low fat di-
ets have however been cited to reduce testosterone con-
centrations during a calorie deficit [53, 54]. however, in a
11 week study of bodybuilders dieting for competition,
plasma testosterone and igf-1 concentrations decreased,
despite subjects consuming a relatively high fat intake (en-
ergy 25% or (1.18 g / kg bw) . differentiating between
the effects of fat and energy intake on hormone concen-
trations is clearly a challenge. the intakes recorded in this
study in conjunction with high protein and high carbohy-
drate diets may therefore merit further investigation.
finally, the low fat intakes seen here may reflect a
paradigm shift between the present day, and the
1980 ’s and 90 ’s where the majority observational stud-
ies of bodybuilders were performed . likewise the
results reported here may also reflect a difference in
approach between british and american bodybuilders,
with all six recent case studies opted for a higher fat
approach [3 –8].
supplementation and caffeine intake
male and female competitors routinely consumed be-
tween 5 and 7 supplements during contest preparation.
protein powders, multivitamins, bcaa and creatine were
the most commonly consumed supplements in agreement
with previous observations of gymnasium users, athletes
and bodybuilders [55 –57]. whey protein was routinely
consumed at breakfast and post resistance training. in
contrast, casein-based supplements were commonly con-
sumed as the last meal of the day. the use of protein in
this manner suggests nutrient timing strategies, the effect-
iveness of which has been called into question .
branch chain amino acids are used as means of maximally
stimulating mps over the course of the day by providing a
bolus dose of bcaa every few hours along with or be-
tween meals, for the preservation of lbm in what is com-
monly referred to as a ‘pulsing strategy ’. however
when the muscle full effect is considered, the use of
bcaa as part of a high protein diet may offer little if any
additional stimulation of mps . moreover, the daily
doses of bcaa (30 g) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbuty-
rate (2 g), consumed by the athletes in the kistler et al. 
case study failed to prevent a greater loss of lbm com-
pared to rossow et al. .
specialist fat burning and pre-exercise supplements
were also popular amongst this cohort. pre-exercise sup-
plements often contained combinations of vitamins,
minerals, amino acids, creatine, caffeine and lactate
buffers usually in the form of beta alanine, citrulline
malate and arginine. the efficacy of these individualchappell et al. journal of the international society of sports nutrition (2018) 15:4 page 9 of 12ingredients have been reviewed for natural bodybuilding
; however, their use in combination is largely un-
known. in addition, because caffeine is a prominent in-
gredient in many of these supplements, competitors
should consider the contribution these supplements
make to their caffeine intake. this point is particularly
pertinent when considering competitors may often con-
sume large amounts of energy drinks and hot beverages
[5–7]. indeed, several competitors exceeded the 400 mg
per day safety consumption limits specified by the
european food safety agency for caffeine. although
these consumption limits are based on a 70 kg individ-
ual, competitors should be aware that intakes above
9 mg /kg bw may be ergolytic as well as having unin-
tended side effects [60, 61].
limitations
there are limitations with the method used to assess
dietary intake, under-reporting of habitual dietary en-
ergy intake is estimated to be between 18 to 54% in
non-bodybuilding populatio ns . in particular carbo-
hydrates tend to be under-reported, while protein in-
take over reported . likewise, foods that portray a
negative health image such as confectionary are often
under reported while foods that portray a positive
health image such as fruits and vegetables are over re-
ported . the prevalence of under- or over reporting
within bodybuilding population is unknown, however
bodybuilders are known for their strict adherence to
dietary plans [3 –8]. the dietary recall only incorporated
as i n g l ed a y ’s intake at three arbitrary time points. as a
result, competitors largely reported their dietary intake
for training days, while intake on non-training days is
likely to be lower. this bias likely resulted in inflated
values for energy intake, furthermore strategies such as
carbohydrate and calorie cycling were likely missed by
the single day recall method. despite the limitations of
t h em e t h o du s e dt oc a p t u r ed i e t a r yi n t a k ew ew e r ea b l e
to detect a reduction of energy intake over time. more-
over, a single day ’s intake may have led to misclassifica-
tion of dietary diversity, although the diet diversity
scores are agreement with previous accounts of body-
building menus.
the bf% values used to estimate the ffmi of competi-
tors are based on self-reported accounts using skin calli-
pers. competitors did not report if these skinfold test
were carried out by trained professionals. although, the
values reported were plausible (essentially they match
with the values reported elsewhere amongst competitive
bodybuilders taken form objective measures) for com-
petitors competing in a national competition, we omit-
ted to include them in the report along with the
subjectively obtain values as they should not be regarded
as accurate.conclusions
the cross-sectional nature of this study makes it difficult
to draw any definitive conclusion on what may be the
best dietary approaches for contest preparation in nat-
ural bodybuilders. our questionnaire was limited in
scope and there are multiple variables that likely influ-
ence competitive outcome. likewise, the sample size
may have reduced our ability to detect statistical signifi-
cance. in spite of these limitations, our study is distinct-
ive in its applied nature attempting to correlate cross
sectional data with competition outcome. the findings
of this study required corroboration, and should be
interpreting with caution. however, it is likely our find-
ings will be of interest to pre-competition bodybuilders
and those seeking to reduce fat mass while maintaining
lbm who may wish to know strategies employed by
bodybuilders in the placed cohort of a high level national
bodybuilding competition.
this study also provides a contemporary account of
current bodybuilding practices and provides additional
evidence for the formation of research informed ap-
proaches to natural bodybuilding contest preparation.
future studies should focus on the use of standardizes
body composition measurement techniques to assess
changes in ffm during contest preparation. further-
more, beyond case studies the literature is lacking in
longitudinal studies of competitive bodybuilders. larger
scale longitudinal studies of competitive natural body-
builders using with frequent sampling points would be
of value to researchers in this field.

abstract: much has been achieved by recent research to increase understanding of the links between
nutrition and muscle health. focusing on muscle strength as the key component of sarcopenia, the
aim of this overview was to evaluate its links to nutrition, both to variation in habitual diets in older
populations, as well as considering supplementation e ects in trials. a main message from the
reviewed studies is that while many provide suggestive evidence of benefits of higher nutrient intakes
and diets of higher quality, findings are inconsistent, and data on muscle strength are often lacking.
to assess the potential of optimising diets as a strategy to promote and maintain muscle strength,
gaps in current evidence need to be addressed. these include the need for (i) better understanding
of individual di erences in responsiveness to dietary change, and the need for targeted nutritional
support; (ii) clearer distinction between protective and therapeutic actions of diet; and (iii) definition
of the role of dietary patterns and their influence on muscle strength, to allow e ects of changes in
food consumption to be evaluated—particularly when combined with physical activity. development
of this evidence is needed to enable translation into appropriate dietary recommendations for
older populations.

1. sarcopenia
sarcopenia is a skeletal muscle disorder that is characterised by the loss of strength and mass
together with impairment in physical function. although more common among older people, and seen
principally as an age-related condition, it is also found in younger adults and, importantly, is influenced
by risk factors operating across the lifecourse [ 1]. sarcopenia is associated with an array of poor health
outcomes that include frailty, hospitalisation and mortality [ 1–3]. it was formally recognised with an
international classification of diseases-10 code in 2016.
in the decades since its first description [ 4], sarcopenia has become a focus of intense research
activity—both to understand its underpinning pathophysiology as well to consider translation of this
knowledge into prevention and treatment strategies [ 1]. the importance of exercise and physical
activity [ 5,6] as well as nutrition [ 7,8], as modifiable influences on muscle health and function, has
long been known. there is a large body of evidence that shows clear benefits of exercise interventions
both to prevent and treat losses of muscle strength and mass in older people [ 9,10]; in particular, the
ecacy of resistance exercise training is well established [ 11]. however, in comparison, the links with
nutrients 2019 ,11, 2942; doi:10.3390 /nu11122942 www.mdpi.com /journal /nutrientsnutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 2 of 17
nutrition, and the potential of dietary change to improve muscle outcomes, are not well understood [ 1].
although much has been achieved in research in the past decade, and the evidence base has developed
substantially, the nature of optimal diets to support the maintenance of muscle strength and mass
in older age has yet to be defined. furthermore, outside the context of malnutrition, which has
recognised overlap with sarcopenia [ 12], the impact of poor habitual diets and marginal nutrient
intakes, as described in older populations, is not certain [ 13]. given the prevalence and the impact of
sarcopenia, there is a pressing need for this evidence to enable translation into appropriate dietary
recommendations for older populations to optimise muscle health.
one of the challenges in understanding current evidence of the role of nutrition is the number
of dierent aspects of muscle health that have been considered as outcomes, both in observational
studies as well as in intervention trials. these include muscle mass and muscle strength (measured
in dierent ways), measures of physical performance, as well as sarcopenia that, in turn, may have
been diagnosed according to di erent criteria. to researchers outside the field, there is a risk that these
dierent muscle parameters may be seen to be equivalent, and even to be considered interchangeably.
so, an important development has been the recent publication of revised guidelines on the definition
and diagnosis of sarcopenia by the european working group on sarcopenia in older people [ 14]. the
new guidelines, which aim to improve consistency in the identification of sarcopenia in clinical care,
identify muscle strength as the key characteristic of sarcopenia with low muscle strength leading to a
diagnosis of probable sarcopenia; subsequent identification of low muscle mass in individuals who
have low muscle strength is used to confirm its presence and, when physical performance is also poor,
its severity (figure 1).

as well as a tool to improve identification of sarcopenia, this new guidance may also o er a useful
structure within which to evaluate influences on muscle health, including the e ects of di erences in
diet. the aim of this review was therefore to consider current evidence on the role of nutrition as an
influence on sarcopenia but, to align with the ewgsop2 guidance [ 14], to focus primarily on its linksnutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 3 of 17
to muscle strength. we therefore have not included detail on other muscle outcomes, although these
were reported in some of the reviewed studies.
2. nutrition in older age
alongside lower levels of physical activity and a reduction in energy needs in older age, food
consumption declines and energy intakes fall. the e ect of age on energy intake is significant. for
example, in a recent meta-analysis of studies of healthy adults, this amounted to a di erence of
approximately 20% when comparing younger (aged 26 years) and older (aged 70 years) groups [ 15],
and steeper declines in intake have been reported among even older adults [ 16]. the drivers of low
food intake include the e ects of age-related changes in sensory perception [ 17], poor oral health [ 18]
and impaired appetite [ 19], that can act to reduce meal size and eating frequency and may also a ect
food choice. in particular, appetite loss, described as the ‘anorexia of ageing’, is often reported and is a
key determinant of nutritional risk [ 20]. however, influences on diet in older age are complex and, in
addition to these physiological changes, there is an array of wider contextual and personal factors
that also impact on dietary intake [ 21]. notably, in parallel with declining energy intake, intakes of
other nutrients, including protein and micronutrients, are also likely to fall [ 22]. as requirements for
some nutrients do not change, or may even increase in older age, without greater consumption of
nutrient-dense foods it can become more challenging for older adults to meet nutrient needs [ 23]. this
underlines the need for a diet of adequate quality—potentially at the same time as food access and
preparation are becoming more challenging and diets more monotonous, contributing to nutritional
risk. although the prevalence of poor diets varies across studies of older populations, consistent with
this concern, low diet quality is common in developed settings [ 24] and malnutrition rates are high [ 25].
3. mechanistic considerations
there is now a body of evidence that links poor nutrition to adverse e ects on muscle in older
age, suggesting that strategies that support older adults to maintain nutrient intake could help to
preserve muscle strength and mass—and could be e ective both to prevent and treat sarcopenia.
although the underpinning physiology is not fully understood, a number of possible mechanisms are
recognised. firstly, low food consumption can lead to insu cient energy intakes; the ensuing loss of
body weight is due not only to depletion of stored fat but also to the catabolism of muscle, leading
to reduced muscle mass [ 26]. secondly, protein requirements may be increased in older age. apart
from providing amino acids, the consumption of dietary protein is an anabolic stimulus that has direct
eects on muscle protein synthesis. as this response has been shown to be blunted among older adults,
their protein intakes may need to be relatively greater to maintain nitrogen balance and to prevent
losses of muscle mass and strength [ 7,27]. thirdly, there may be important anti-oxidant e ects of
some dietary components. oxidative stress, arising from the accumulation of reactive oxygen species
(ros) can damage biomolecules in muscle [ 28] and, via e ects on signalling pathways, is also linked to
inflammation [ 29]. whilst normally counterbalanced by e ects of endogenous antioxidants, the role of
exogenous antioxidants may be significant [ 30]; ensuring su cient intakes of dietary antioxidants in
older age, such as carotenoids and selenium, may therefore o er protection against oxidative damage
to muscle tissue. fourthly, the links between inflammation and sarcopenia point both to the potential
benefits of dietary factors that have anti-inflammatory e ects, such as n-3 fatty acids, as well as the
importance of dietary influences on adiposity, particularly visceral adiposity, that contribute to a
low-grade inflammatory state [ 13]. supplementation with n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids
(lcpufas) has a lowering e ect on crp , il-6 and tnf- levels; manipulation of the balance and
dietary content of n-3 and n-6 lcpufas may therefore have potential as an approach to prevent or
treat sarcopenia [ 31]. finally, there is suggestive evidence of influences of other dietary components,
but for which understanding of the underpinning mechanisms is currently less clear. the best example
of these may be vitamin d, for which there is considerable interest in the links between status and
muscle function [ 7]. but recently, with increased understanding of the role and influence of the gutnutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 4 of 17
microbiota on health, e ects on skeletal muscle function, potentially via e ects on anabolic resistance,
have also been suggested [ 32]. these e ects could be important and, as diet is a key influence on
microbial composition in the gut , merit further study.
4. nutrition and muscle strength
the growth in evidence that examines links between diet and muscle outcomes in older populations
has enabled collation of findings to establish consistency across studies and, in some cases, meta-analyses
to evaluate e ect size. the following sections provide an overview of current evidence on muscle
strength, focusing particularly, where available, on recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
4.1. observational evidence
4.1.1. protein
there has been intense interest in the role of protein in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia, linked to
anabolic resistance, and the possibility that dietary requirements for protein are increased in older age.
there is some observational evidence that has examined links between habitual protein intakes and
muscle strength. most recently, a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational evidence was
published by coelho-junior and colleagues [ 34]. the authors examined di erences between study
participants, aged 60 years or older, who had high ( 1.0 g/kg body weight) or very high ( 1.2 g/kg)
daily protein intakes with those with lower levels of intake ( <0.8 g/kg; 0.8–0.99 g /kg). upper limb
muscle strength was assessed by isometric handgrip strength; lower limb strength by measured chair
rise time or knee extensor strength. in total, six studies reporting strength outcomes were evaluated in
meta-analyses. overall, although some di erences were described among older adults who had high
protein intakes, these were non-significant. notably, the lack of di erences in muscle strength di ered
from findings for physical performance in this review; for example, faster walking speed was found
among older adults whose protein intakes were higher .
however, other observational data on muscle strength, published around the time of this review,
yielded di erent findings; positive e ects of higher protein intakes were found in cross-sectional studies
of younger and older adults. the largest of these studies was the uk biobank cohort of 146,816 adults
aged 40–69 years [ 35]. in this analysis, graded increases in grip strength (expressed as kg /kg body
weight) across the range of daily protein intakes from <0.8 g/kg to 2 g /kg were observed. consistent
with this finding, a positive association between protein intake and muscle strength (expressed as
kg/bmi) was also reported in a recent study of a diverse cohort (2468 adults aged 33 to 71 years)
in the us [ 36]. in both studies, the associations were seen in men and women, and adjusted for a
wide range of covariates, including age, ethnicity, social status, smoking and comorbidities. the
apparent inconsistency when comparing these findings with the meta-analyses is unlikely to be due
to dierences in the ages of participants, as a lack of independent associations between total protein
intake and muscle strength has been reported in other cross-sectional analyses of data from cohorts
with comparable age ranges [ 37–39], although in these studies, uncorrected measures of strength (kg)
rather than corrected (per kg or bmi) were reported. such observational findings may simply di er
across cohorts, depending on di erences in participant characteristics, such as their habitual diets,
nutritional status or levels of physical activity. for example, in a recent cross-sectional analysis of
data from an older cohort in the uk (the newcastle 85 +study, 722 community-dwelling men and
women), consistent with the e ects described above [ 35,36], a low protein intake ( <1 g/kg) was found
to associated with lower grip strength (uncorrected, kg) [ 40]. inconsistencies in longitudinal e ects
are also apparent; for example in the newcastle 85 +study, no association was found between protein
intake and subsequent decline in strength [ 40], whereas protective e ects of higher levels of protein
intake have been reported in other longitudinal cohorts .nutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 5 of 17
4.1.2. antioxidant nutrients
in comparison with studies of dietary protein, there have been far fewer investigations into the
role of dietary antioxidants, despite known links between markers of oxidative damage, such as
higher serum concentration of protein carbonyls and lower muscle strength [ 41]. there are some
epidemiological studies that support the possibility that variation in dietary antioxidant intake may
influence muscle strength in older age [ 42]. the best known evidence comes from the inchianti
(invecchiare in chianti) and whas (women’s health and aging study) cohorts, in which lower
blood concentrations of selenium, alpha-tocopherol and carotenoids have been shown to be associated
with lower muscle strength in cross-sectional analyses [ 43–45] and, in inchianti, lower carotenoid
status predicted greater loss of strength (handgrip, knee and hip) over a follow-up period of six
years [ 46]. however, relatively little progress has been made in understanding the role of habitual
dietary antioxidant intakes and their influence on muscle strength in the decade since. for example,
in a large study of community-dwelling adults (aged 40–80 years) self-reported use of vitamin c
and e supplements was not related to grip strength or to change in strength over a 5-year follow-up
period [ 47]. also, in a recent systematic review that considered the influence of dietary selenium
on sarcopenia, only five studies were included; whilst two showed di erences in intake between
sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic older adults, no evidence of e ects of selenium on muscle strength
was reported [ 48]. given the recognised role of oxidative damage and its e ects on muscle cells [ 30],
this may be surprising. however, as much has been learnt in this time about the potential benefits of
patterns of diet that provide higher habitual intakes of many of these nutrients (section 4.1.6), more
needs to be known about the potential influence of dietary antioxidants.
4.1.3. anti-inflammatory nutrients
chronic low-grade inflammation is implicated in the aetiology of a range of age-related conditions,
including sarcopenia. for example, among older participants in the hertfordshire ageing study,
a greater ‘inflammaging’ burden, defined by blood inflammatory biomarker concentrations, was
shown to predict lower muscle strength at 10-year follow-up [ 49]. recent research has focused on
the anti-inflammatory e ects of diet—particularly on the role of lcpufas [ 31]. at present, there
is little observational evidence that links di erences in habitual lcpufa intake to muscle strength,
although in a cross-sectional analysis, greater oily fish consumption (rich in n-3 lcpufas) was found
to be associated with greater grip strength among older community-dwelling adults—importantly,
a dierence that was not observed in relation to consumption of white fish [ 50]. other studies have
also reported a link where higher reported intakes of n-3 fatty acids [ 51] and higher status (total
plasma phospholipid n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) were related to measures of muscle strength [ 52],
although in both of these studies the observed di erences were mainly attenuated following adjustment
for confounders. in a recent review of the e ects of n-3 fatty acids, rossato and colleagues comment
on the inconsistency of the available observational evidence, suggesting that the lack of independent
associations in the adjusted statistical models that link n-3 intakes and status with muscle strength may
be evidence of their indirect rather than direct e ects .
one challenge in understanding the role of lcpufas from observational evidence is the collinearity
of dietary constituents—such that older adults who have higher intakes may di er in their habitual
diets, with lcpufas acting as markers for other dietary constituents, and it is these that are causally
related to muscle health [ 7]. for example, high lcpufa intakes may just indicate ‘healthier’ diets
that have a higher content of bioactive components with anti-inflammatory actions, such as dietary
flavonoids [ 54,55]. the development of a dietary inflammatory index (dii) is therefore important, as
this enables the overall inflammatory potential of the diet to be evaluated by summing the inflammatory
eects of a number of individual dietary components, that include -carotene, fatty acids, vitamins a,
c and e and zinc [ 56]. cervo and colleagues have recently described prospective associations between
dii, assessed in this way, and measures of musculoskeletal health for the first time, using data from
1098 participants in the tasmanian older adult cohort study. however, while the authors foundnutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 6 of 17
negative e ects on bone health associated with a more proinflammatory diet, apart from an unexpected
increase in lower limb muscle quality, there were no associations with muscle strength .
4.1.4. vitamin d
the mechanisms that link vitamin d insu ciency to sarcopenic changes in older age are not
fully understood. however, as proximal muscle weakness is a feature of clinical vitamin d deficiency,
and low vitamin d status is common in many older populations, there is considerable interest in
the potential benefits of therapeutic interventions to improve status. the interest in vitamin d has
led to a sizeable body of research to develop understanding of its links to muscle health [ 50]. much
of this research is interventional (summarised in section 4.2.4); less is known about the di erences
observed in vitamin d status across older populations and their implications for muscle strength.
overall, the messages from the observational evidence of vitamin d status and muscle strength appear
to be mixed [ 57]. for example, low vitamin d status at baseline was associated with a greater loss of
grip strength over a three-year follow-up period among older participants in the longitudinal aging
study amsterdam [ 58]; in contrast, among older participants in the health abc study, whilst baseline
status was associated with lower muscle strength, it did not predict losses of muscle strength over
the following four years [ 59]. such inconsistencies between studies, which may arise from di erences
in study design and population characteristics, also persist in more recent research, in which both
positive associations , as well as lack of associations [61,62], with vitamin d have been reported.
4.1.5. foods
apart from the recognised limitations of observational data to draw causal inferences, the
collinearity between dietary components challenges interpretation of studies of single nutrients. there
are therefore advantages to using a whole-foods approach. in particular, this allows consideration
of grouped dietary constituents that are found together in the same foods, and, while potentially of
less value to understand underpinning mechanisms, it has important implications for public health
considerations. however, to date there have been few studies of whole foods and there is currently
little observational evidence of e ects on muscle strength. there is some research to suggest benefits of
higher consumption of fruit and vegetables [ 50,63] and dairy foods [ 64]. for example, in an australian
study of 1456 older women (aged 70–85 years) higher dairy consumption (milk, yogurt and cheese)
was associated with greater grip strength. however, evidence is very limited; further data from new
studies of whole foods are needed to be able assess their significance for the protection and promotion
of muscle health in older age.
4.1.6. dietary patterns
greater progress has been made over the past decade in the use of dietary patterns to understand
the role of habitual diets in the aetiology of sarcopenia [ 65]. in common with a whole-foods approach,
patterns analysis enables evaluation of the overall e ects of qualitative di erences in diet, taking
account of potential synergistic and other interactions between dietary constituents. there is now
a sucient number of studies that have described dietary patterns in relation to the components of
sarcopenia to enable collation of this evidence. the first systematic review of the e ects of di erences
in diet ‘quality’ (describing a ‘healthier’ profile of foods) was reported by bloom and colleagues in
2018 [ 66]. the review included 23 studies of older adults; 11 reported data on muscle strength. as diet
quality was assessed using a priori scores ( n=8) and patterns analysis ( n=3), the di erences in its
definition prevented the authors from including the studies in a meta-analysis. of the 11 studies
reviewed, only five found positive associations with muscle strength, and patterns of association were
not consistent across types of study design (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal) or between genders. this
lack of consistency was in contrast to clearer evidence of links between higher diet quality and better
measured physical performance [ 66]. the lack of common patterns of association between diet quality
and di erent muscle outcomes echoes findings of recent reviews of the e ects of the mediterraneannutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 7 of 17
dietary pattern, with some mixed e ects shown for strength, frailty and functional disability among
older population groups [ 67,68], although in a new study of older women (aged 60–85 years), higher
muscle (grip) strength was found among participants who complied with a mediterranean dietary
pattern [ 69]. further evidence to improve understanding of the importance and role of dietary patterns
for muscle health is needed. as habitual diets of higher quality should provide greater intakes of
a range of nutrients and non-nutrients that are linked to muscle health, and may also be linked to
beneficial e ects on gut microbial composition [ 32,33], their potential protective benefits in older age
could be significant .
4.2. dietary interventions
while existing observational evidence of links between nutrition and muscle strength in older age
may not yield clear messages, the prevalence of poor nutrition in older populations, together with
established mechanistic links between nutrition and muscle function, suggest that intervention to
increase nutrient intake has potential to improve outcomes—at least among older individuals who are
at nutritional risk. there is now a sizeable body of literature on the e ects of nutrient supplementation,
although there are challenges in collating the findings of these studies arising from di erences in study
design, the nature of populations studied, nutrients provided (singly or in combinations), the dose
and duration of supplementation, and most notably, whether combined with exercise training or not.
to date there have been few studies of whole food provision as a device to increase nutrient intake,
and even less is currently known about the e cacy of making overall changes in dietary patterns to
achieve gains in muscle strength.
4.2.1. protein and amino acid supplementation
the most studied types of dietary supplement to improve muscle outcomes are proteins and amino
acids. in the systematic review for the first report of the european working group on sarcopenia in
older people, 11 of the 12 included studies contained protein, essential amino acids or hmb (a leucine
metabolite) [ 6]. the findings from this review, consistent with the observational evidence of di erences
in habitual protein intake (section 4.1.1), showed the e ects of supplementation to be mixed. more
recent systematic reviews of protein /amino acid supplementation studies of older adults have yielded
similar findings [ 70–72]. for example, in the first of these reviews, although some evidence of benefit
was found in individual studies of older adults, pooled analyses showed that the overall e ects on
muscle strength were not significant [ 70]; in the second, meta-analyses of data from supplemented
non-frail community-dwelling older adults showed that while there was a tendency for grip strength
to increase in protein-supplemented participants (standardised mean di erence: 0.58; 95% ci:  0.08 to
1.24, p=0.08), there were no di erences in lower extremity strength .
however, the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis of data from 32 large rcts of
nutritional supplementation of older adults, reported by veronese and colleagues (evidence published
up to september 2018) [ 72], showed that supplementation with protein or amino acids improved
handgrip strength ( n=7 studies; smd 0.24, 95% ci 0.07 to 0.41). positive e ects were also seen in
trials of ‘multinutrient’ supplements, the majority of which also included protein or amino acids ( n=6
studies; smd 0.41, 95% ci 0.06 to 0.76). in contrast, few associations were found with measured
physical performance. an important feature of this review was the separate consideration given to
the eects of supplementation among trial participants who di ered in health status. for chair rise
time and handgrip strength, there were significant interactions, such that the improvements in muscle
strength were seen particularly among participants a ected by frailty or sarcopenia [ 72]. this finding
may be key to understanding inconsistencies in current evidence but is generally underexplored. more
needs to be known about individual responsiveness to dietary supplementation, and its determinants,
to inform future nutritional strategies to promote muscle health in older age.nutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 8 of 17
4.2.2. antioxidant supplementation
the observational evidence (section 4.1.2), together with the recognised role of oxidative stress in
the aetiology of sarcopenia, point to the potential of antioxidant supplementation to promote muscle
health in older age [ 73]. however, there have been few trials of supplementation in older populations,
and such benefits remain uncertain [ 74]. there has been some experimental and clinical research that
has focused on supplementation e ects on muscle responses to exercise but, to date, findings have been
inconsistent [ 30]. this may partly reflect the dual functions of ros, such that low levels are linked to
increased muscle force, with high levels linked to declines in physical performance [ 73]—limiting the
success of interventions that aim to suppress their activities. furthermore, a recent trial of high-dose
vitamin c and e supplementation in older men has raised concerns as it showed that some of the
adaptations to strength training were blunted following supplementation [ 75]. at present, there is
insucient evidence to consider the use of antioxidant supplements as a nutritional strategy to prevent
age-related losses of muscle strength and mass, or to treat sarcopenia .
4.2.3. anti-inflammatory nutrient supplementation
supplementation with n-3 lcpufas can a ect protein synthesis via mtor signalling as well as
impact on inflammatory responses [ 7], and their use, to prevent and treat sarcopenia, which is a focus
of current research. in a recent review, dupont and colleagues summarised the findings of four studies
of supplementation of older adults; four further studies combined supplementation with physical
exercise (reviewed in section 4.3) [ 31]. overall, the e ects of supplementation appeared promising,
with measured di erences found in muscle protein synthesis and physical performance. however, the
eects of n-3 lcpufa supplementation on muscle strength were less clear; of the trials that reported
muscle strength outcomes, increases were reported in one , whereas no e ects were found in two
others [ 77,78]. with limited evidence to date, some inconsistencies are likely to arise from di erences in
dose and duration of supplementation, as well as di erences in participant characteristics, and further
research is needed .
4.2.4. vitamin d supplementation
in comparison with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutrients, there is a much larger body
of research that has examined the e ects of vitamin d supplementation on muscle outcomes—and a
number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of this evidence have been conducted [ 7]. early reviews
suggested that vitamin d supplementation of older adults improved muscle strength, although e ects
were modest [ 79,80]. however, two recent reviews have not confirmed benefits of supplementation on
muscle strength. in the systematic review by rosendahl-riise and colleagues, seven studies (published
up to april 2016) were included; in the majority of these, there was no improvement in in handgrip
strength, and the overall change in the meta-analysis was non-significant [ 81]. consistent with this
finding, the more recent meta-analysis by veronese and colleagues also showed no overall e ects on
muscle strength in reviewed trials of vitamin d supplementation [ 72]. there may be di erences in
responses across studies according to the vitamin d status of the participants. for example, in a review
of 17 rcts, stockton and colleagues found no e ects of vitamin d supplementation on muscle strength
among adults who had serum 25(oh)d concentrations >25 nmol /l at baseline, whereas a significant
eect of supplementation on hip muscle strength was observed among deficient participants (25(oh)d
<25 nmol /l) . however, in the meta-analysis reported by rosendahl-riise and colleagues, the
observed heterogeneity in supplementation e ects on strength was eliminated after exclusion of three
studies of deficient participants; furthermore, their exclusion revealed a small overall gain in handgrip
strength among participants who had su cient status at baseline [ 81]. at present, the benefits of
vitamin d supplementation to achieve improvements in muscle strength are therefore unclear.nutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 9 of 17
4.2.5. changing patterns of food intake
relatively few studies have used supplementation with whole foods or manipulation of dietary
patterns to improve muscle outcomes [ 65]. there have been some studies of milk and dairy products,
although mostly these used milk /whey proteins. in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis
of dairy protein e ects on muscle strength, hanach and colleagues included 14 studies; only four
investigated the e ects of supplementation with a whole dairy food (ricotta cheese) or milk-based
protein . the meta-analysis showed no overall e ects on muscle strength.
other foods of interest are fruit and vegetables. although the e ects of increasing intakes of
some of their constituents (e.g., antioxidant nutrients (section 4.2.2), dietary nitrates [ 84]) have been
studied, there are few data on the e ects of increased consumption of the whole foods. evidence from
the first rct was reported by neville and colleagues in 2013 [ 85]: older participants who had low
fruit and vegetable consumption (two or fewer portions per day) were randomised either to maintain
their habitual diet or, provided with free fruit and vegetables, to increase daily consumption to five
or more portions, for a period of 16 weeks. whilst there were no e ects on physical performance
(sppb), there was a trend towards a gain in grip strength at the end of this period (mean change in
the intervention group (2.04 5.16 kg) compared with the control group (0.11 3.26 kg)). although
of borderline statistical significance ( p=0.06), the e ect size is large and suggests that there may be
important benefits of increasing intake of fruit and vegetable among low consumers. the authors
highlighted the need for further randomised controlled trials in older populations to examine the
eects of increasing fruit and vegetable consumption for muscle health of older adults, stressing the
need to ensure future trials are of adequate size and duration .
greater fruit and vegetable consumption are hallmarks of ‘healthier’ dietary patterns, and the
eects on muscle strength described in the rct may be consistent with greater muscle strength seen
among adults whose dietary patterns comply with this profile [ 69]. at present, there is almost no
evidence from trials of manipulation of dietary patterns to be able to assess this, although the clear
potential for improvements in muscle health in older populations deserves further exploration .
4.3. nutrition and exercise interventions
the interactions between nutrition and physical activity may be important [ 86], and many
intervention studies have combined nutritional supplementation with exercise training to enable the
potential for additive or synergistic e ects on muscle health to be explored. a number of reviews have
collated this evidence; all point to the degree of heterogeneity across studies, particularly in terms of
study design and participant characteristics, and, overall, the lack of conclusive messages that can be
drawn [87–89].
however, some studies have suggested synergistic e ects, such that exercise training may only be
eective among supplemented participants, or that the training e ects are enhanced in supplemented
individuals. two current examples of interest are supplementation with protein /amino acids or with
n-3 lcpufas. in the most recent systematic review and meta-analysis, hou and colleagues included 21
rcts of older participants (published january 2004 to may 2018). protein supplementation combined
with resistance training resulted in greater gains in muscle strength, although di erences in physical
performance were not found [ 90]. comparable e ects have been described in primary studies of n-3
lcpufa supplementation in which greater strength gains have been observed among supplemented
older women who received training [ 91,92], but not in men [ 92]. since the number of studies of
lcpufas is still small, further research is needed to confirm such e ects.
the combined e ects of food supplementation with exercise training is very limited, although in
a trial of combined exercise training with /without increased meat consumption in a group of older
women, daly and colleagues reported greater gains in muscle strength in response to resistance exercise
training in the meat group, in comparison with control resistance-trained participants [ 93]. however,
in contrast, increased consumption of fortified milk in combination with exercise training has not
been shown to enhance training e ects [ 94]. perhaps the most encouraging data come from a recentnutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 10 of 17
swedish rct in older women, a rare example of a combined resistance exercise training and dietary
intervention to improve muscle outcomes, in which the change was an alteration in dietary pattern,
specifically, to increase compliance with a ‘healthier’ dietary pattern over a period of 24 weeks (based
on wholegrain foods, fruits and vegetables, fish, and polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils and
nuts) [ 95,96]. improvements in muscle power were seen both in the exercise and the exercise–healthy
diet groups, but the gains were greater in the group that combined exercise training with a healthier
pattern of diet [ 95]. furthermore, combined resistance training with this dietary change has recently
been shown to result in a significant hypertrophy of type iia muscle fibres—suggesting its potential to
reverse age-related e ects [ 96]. much more needs to be known about the e ects of changing dietary
patterns when combined with exercise training or increased physical activity, and the potential of this
approach to protect and promote muscle health among older adults.
5. evidence summary
the aim of this review was to provide an overview of current evidence that links di erences in
diet and nutritional status to muscle strength, a key characteristic of sarcopenia [ 14], considering both
variation in habitual diets in observational studies, as well as supplementation e ects in intervention
studies and randomised trials. a number of messages come from the reviewed evidence. firstly, whilst
many observational studies provide suggestive evidence of both higher nutrient intakes and habitual
diets of higher quality being linked with greater muscle strength in older adults, findings are often
inconsistent, with the benefits observed in some studies balanced by lack of e ects seen in others.
secondly, trial evidence of the e ects of dietary change achieved through nutrient supplementation,
or changes in food consumption, is often lacking (antioxidant nutrients, lcpufas, whole foods and
dietary patterns) or, in common with the observational studies, is inconsistent in its findings (protein,
vitamin d). while there are likely to be many contributing factors to this lack of consistency, arising
particularly from di erences in study populations, both in observational studies and trials, as well
as dierences in study design, overall, there is currently little evidence from these studies of muscle
strength to inform dietary recommendations for older populations. for example, there is continuing
debate regarding protein requirements in older age. while essential amino acids, particularly leucine,
are considered key to the anabolic response, the optimal amount and balance of animal (leucine-rich)
protein vs. plant protein in the diet remains to be defined [ 97]. additionally, di erences in the
timing /pattern of protein consumption and meal feeding also need further investigation [ 98,99].
however, a third message from the reviewed studies is that improvements in strength have been found
in trials that combine dietary change with exercise training. although evidence of benefit from this
type of trial has often been mixed [ 88], and the balance of existing studies is largely from interventions
based on protein /amino acid supplements, there appears to be some consistency in recent meta-analysis
of this evidence. intriguingly there is also suggestion of comparable e ects in some recent studies
of dierent types of dietary intervention ( n-3 lcpufas, dietary pattern), although further research
is needed. finally, this review focused on muscle strength, and the messages may di er had other
muscle outcomes been considered. for example, the meta-analysis reported by hou and colleagues
found di erences in muscle strength, but not in physical performance, resulting from combined protein
supplementation and exercise training [ 90]; conversely, the systematic review of observational studies
by bloom and colleagues suggested benefits of diets of higher quality for physical performance, but
found inconsistent evidence of e ects on strength [ 66]. in part this may be explained by the balance of
evidence currently available for review, but it does highlight the need for a clear focus on individual
muscle outcomes. although physical performance is strongly linked to muscle strength [ 100], it is
multidimensional, also involving central and peripheral nervous system function [ 14]. any di erences
in eects according to muscle outcome may therefore be informative, indicating the need for clear
delineation of dietary e ects on separate aspects of muscle health.nutrients 2019 ,11, 2942 11 of 17
6. conclusions
there is currently insu cient evidence to be able to assess the potential of optimising diets as
a way of protecting or promoting muscle strength among community-dwelling older adults. some
supplementation studies have been e ective, suggesting that increases in nutrient intake may be
needed by at-risk individuals. however, outside the context of malnutrition, the role of poor habitual
diets is less clear. even for protein supplementation, for which there is a significant body of research
showing positive e ects on muscle strength [ 72], there is less evidence that low habitual protein intakes
are causally linked to sarcopenia in older populations [ 13]. for example, in a two-year supplementation
study of community-dwelling older australian women, provision of a daily high-protein drink did not
change muscle mass or strength [ 101]. this has obvious implications for the possible translation of
existing evidence to define dietary recommendations in older populations.
this review has highlighted a number of gaps in the evidence for future research to address.
a clearer understanding is needed of individual di erences in responsiveness to dietary change.
for example, in their systematic review and meta-analysis, veronese and colleagues found di erential
eects of dietary interventions according to health status, such that protein supplementation was more
eective among frail participants [ 72]. also, a number of studies point to the potential of gender
eects that need further exploration. addressing this gap in understanding may help to explain the
heterogeneity seen across studies and other inconsistencies in the evidence, but more importantly,
could identify the need and importance of targeted nutritional support for some individuals.
for many dietary constituents, more complete information is needed to enable understanding
of their e ects on muscle strength. in particular, dietary messages for younger and older adults may
dier; more needs to be known about the distinction between protective actions, perhaps central
to future preventive strategies for younger adults, compared with therapeutic actions, which could
be used for treatment of older adults who have sarcopenia. however, progress in developing this
evidence may rely on future improvements in dietary assessment methodology. traditional methods
are commonly based on self-reported intakes that are burdensome, which may limit participation [ 102],
and associated with measurement error. novel approaches are therefore needed, including exploration
of the potential of combining reported intakes with dietary biomarkers .
further evidence is also needed about the role of dietary patterns and whole foods, as influences on
muscle strength, to be able to evaluate the potential benefits of changes in patterns of food consumption
that increase intakes of groups of nutrients and non-nutrients at the same time. for example, changing
dietary patterns to a ‘healthier’ profile of foods could increase intakes of plant bioactive components as
well as nutrients—an approach that would be expected to be more e ective than simple supplementation
with single nutrients. such changes in diet could also have positive implications for the composition of
the gut microbiota, recently linked to beneficial e ects on muscle health .
aligned with improving understanding of the e ects of changes in dietary patterns, their
interaction with exercise training needs further study. although the limited evidence available suggests
that dietary change to a healthier profile of foods, in combination with exercise training, is e ective [ 95],
other studies are needed to confirm and develop these findings. such an approach—promoting diet
quality alongside increased physical activity—would align with existing public health guidance and
could be easily applied.
at present, our understanding of the role and importance of nutrition in aetiology of low muscle
strength and sarcopenia is incomplete, preventing evaluation of the potential of using dietary change
for prevention or treatment. however, the sound mechanistic links between nutrition and muscle
function, together with some of the current evidence, suggest that further research is needed to develop
understanding and enable consideration of implications for future dietary recommendations to protect
and promote muscle health in older populations.

background
in times of “body worship,” men’s interest in strength 
training and nutrition is increasing. public gyms and fit-ness clubs promote active lifestyles. often, physical activity alone is not the final goal of men and women “gym-goers”. among fitness club regulars, there is an increasing focus on body appearance and proportions. in every 10th man, this phenomenon takes the form of a dis-ease known as bigorexia (cella et al., 2012; cerea et al., 
2018; eichstadt et al., 2020; mitchell, murray, et al., 2017; mosley, 2009). many authors in their research on athletes indicate numerous nutritional errors and the phe-nomenon of incorrect supplementation, which can lead to malaise, injury, or lack of progression (iraki et al., 2019; 
lenzi et al., 2019; mitchell, hackett, et al., 2017; panansiewicz and grochowicz, 2016; wrzosek et al., 2016). one of the most serious mistakes is the incorrect level of protein in the diet. too little protein leads to impaired tissue growth and development as well as mal-nutrition and even death. too much protein in the diet causes an increase in body fat, burdening the kidneys and liver, as well as increasing the loss of water and calcium (frączek et al., 2019; górska-kłęk et al., 2008; merino et al., 2013; paddon-jones, 2017; phillips et al., 2007). too much protein supplied to the body can lead to weight gain, dehydration, kidney malfunction, gout, digestive problems, and a sense of depression. too much protein is 970267 jmhxxx10.1177/1557988320970267american journal of men’s healthkarpik et al.

abstract
public gyms and fitness clubs promote active lifestyles. at the same time, numerous nutritional errors and the phenomenon of incorrect supplementation are being observed among the given study group. behavior can lead to malaise, injury, or lack of progression. one of the most serious mistakes is the incorrect level of protein in the diet. the aim of the study is to assess the quantity and quality of protein consumed by men undertaking recreational strength training in szczecin. the study involved 35 men aged 18–35, practicing amateur strength training, from szczecin (poland). the author’s questionnaire collected information on supplementation, physical activity, and subjective assessment of nutritional knowledge. the obtained test results were subjected to statistical analysis performed in the statistica12 program. on average, respondents consumed 1.8 g of protein/kg, with the highest recorded conversion rate of 3.7 g of protein/kg of body weight, and the lowest of 0.9 g/kg of body weight. total protein consumption ranged from 70.2 to 295.7 g, and the average value was 147.8 g (22%), which differs from the study group, that is, 129–133 g, which gives 14% energy proteins. it was found that the protein supplementation, on average, provided 31% of the total protein intake of the study group. the results show inappropriate dietary behavior regarding food supplementation among the examined group. further education on the nutritional value of the food and a healthy and balanced diet is being recommended for the individuals practicing strength sports.

associated with an increased amount of calcium excreted 
in the urine (lentine and wrone, 2004; malhotra et al., 2016). too much protein supply can also affect a young and healthy body. scientists have observed that a high-protein diet used in childhood on healthy children may have a negative impact on the development of their skel-eton and lead to metabolic diseases and kidney damage (bonjour, 2016; fenton et al., 2006; lentine and wrone, 2004; linn et al., 2000; mangano et al., 2015). for an athlete, protein is one of the most important nutrients, because it is a muscle-building material, and it is neces-sary for the regeneration of degraded muscle cells and the reconstruction of muscle glycogen or creatinine synthesis (celejowa, 2008; gawęcki and mossor-pietraszewska, 2005). in addition, it is a basic component of blood, lymph, biological compounds (hormones, enzymes), and immune bodies and acts as a buffer substance that main-tains the proper reaction of body fluids and digestive tract content. it acts as a carrier of some minerals and vitamins and is involved in regulating blood pressure. in addition, the protein is important in thought processes in the brain (celejowa, 2008). daily protein turnover is about 3% (300 g) of protein, and so it is very important to control the proper amount of protein consumed by the athlete (garibotto and verzola, 2016). the need for protein, like other nutrients, depends on the age, weight, height of the body, physical effort, and the physiological state of the body. an adult, healthy person with a normal body weight should take daily allowance (recommended dietary allowance) for protein 0.8–1 g/kg body weight (antonio et al., 2020; bray et al., 2015; lemon, 1995; phillips, 2012). the greater demand for protein results from the progressive period in ontogenetic development, increased physical activity or pregnancy, and lactation in women. energy from protein accounts for 12%–14% of daily energy needs (jeszka, 2003). the body can absorb 30–50 g of protein during one meal, while daily demand depends on age, gender, and sport. in the case of speed-strength and endurance-strength training, the daily demand for protein in the diet increases to 1.4–1.8 g/kg of body weight. in the case of reduction training—fat loss and weight gain program—the amount of protein in the diet should be doubled in relation to the reference values for a healthy person (bandegan et al., 2017; gawęcki and mossor-pietraszewska, 2005; paddon-jones, 2017). excessive amounts of protein provided with a meal, not used for synthesis, play an energy role and are trans-formed in the liver to glucose, fatty acids, and ketone compounds (frączek et al., 2019; merino et al., 2013). increased protein catabolism is associated with the for -
mation of unnecessary metabolism products (e.g., urea), which must be excreted from the body. increased urine output combined with intense exercise can promote chronic dehydration. long-term use of a high-protein diet, even in healthy young people, may lead to kidney and liver overload, acidification of the body, and exces-sive urinary calcium excretion, which is associated with bone decalcification and an increased risk of calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. gastrointestinal disorders may also occur, manifested by excessive gas, which is trouble-some especially for an athlete during the training period (celejowa, 2008; te morenga and mann, 2012).
in the daily demand for protein, not only the quantity 
but above all, the biological quality of the consumed products is important. everyone’s diet should consist of 40%–60% proteins with high biological content, the so-called wholesome proteins and proteins with low biologi-cal content, that is, incomplete proteins, characterized by a low concentration of one or several exogenous amino acids that are necessary for the proper functioning of the body. the wholesome proteins include the proteins of hen’s egg, human milk, and proteins of milk, cheese, poultry, fish, and meat of slaughter animals. among pro-teins with low biological content, we can distinguish legume proteins with the highest biological value and proteins of cereals, vegetables, and potatoes (frączek et al., 2019). for athletes who care about building muscle mass, the most favorable ratio is 1:1.5, that is, approxi-mately 2/3 of animal protein and 1/3 of vegetable protein (celejowa, 2008).
factors that must be taken into account when deter -
mining the amount of protein in an athlete is increasing energy expenditure, increased metabolism and increased production of enzymes, the advantage of anabolic pro-cesses over catabolic processes caused by tissue growth, and their continuous renewal, stress, and loss of nitrogen (celejowa, 2008). during intense physical work on syn-thesis, protein breakdown processes prevail and muscle protein content is lowered. in addition, an important aspect that the athlete has a greater need for protein is the fact that the amino acid alanine plays a very important role in maintaining a stable glucose level in the working muscle. glucose synthesis from alanine is a very efficient process and can ensure long-term muscle work (frączek et al., 2019).
strength sports are characterized by a short physical 
effort performed in an anaerobic form. during this form of training, the body draws energy from glycogen and then from adipose tissue. the biochemical reaction that occurs without the use of oxygen produces lactic acid in the muscles, which requires a healthy regenerative diet rich in carbohydrates and protein. during this type of effort, significant hypoxia occurs, and therefore, it is recommended that the ratio of protein, fat, and carbohy-drate mass be 1:0.99:3.9, which gives 14% protein, 31% fat, and 55% carbohydrates (celejowa, 2008; cermak et al., 2012; iraki et al., 2019; kreider and campbell, 2009; krysztofiak et al., 2012; potgieter, 2013). for this karpik et al. 3
group of athletes, protein energy is recommended at the 
level of about 15% (1.4–1.8 g/kg of body weight) (celejowa, 2008).
due to the high demand for protein in athletes, and at 
the same time providing low-volume and slightly digest-ible food, protein nutrients with easily digestible hydro-lysates are of great importance (celejowa, 2008; chappell et al., 2019; kowaluk and sacharuk, 2004; mitchell et al., 2018).
the aim of the study was to assess the quantitative and 
qualitative content of protein in the men’s menu for rec-
reational strength training in szczecin.
materials and methods
the study was conducted on a group of 35 men practicing 
strength sports. the average age of the surveyed men was 26.4 years (18–35 years). the average body weight of the subjects was 81.8 ± 9.3 kg, average height 180.0 ± 6.9 cm, average body mass index (bmi) 25.22 ± 4.75 kg/m

the anthropometric measurements of the study group are presented in table 1.
in the questionnaire concerning the undertaken physi-
cal activity, 23 (65%) of the respondents reported training experience over 3 years, and only five (14%) had trained for less than 12 months. on the basis of the survey, it was found that 34 (97%) respondents independently set their own training program both in terms of intensity and diet supplementation. protein intake was determined on the basis of dietary diaries and calculated in the diet program “dieteica 5.” the subjects recorded the consumed prod-ucts in a 24-hr questionnaire for 5 days, including at least three training days and one day-off (weekend). the respondents received a paper version of the food diary and guidelines on how to record meals with conversion to grammage. the food diary contains information about the type of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, supper), time of its consumption, consumed products with gram-mage (g, ml), and the method of preparation (boiled, baked, fried). the menu also includes supplementation used by athletes and the duration and intensity of physical exertion used on a given day. among the respondents, a proprietary survey was conducted consisting of 15 ques-tions regarding physical activity, eating habits, and the level of knowledge about dietary supplementation. the body composition analyzer x-contact 350 using the impedance method was used to assess body mass and body composition (body fat percentage [fatp], fat-free mass[ffm], total body water percentage [tbw]). the respondents were informed that they should take body composition measurements before training (a break from the last physical activity at least 12 hr) and on an empty stomach (the previous meal at least 4 hr earlier). for 24 hr before the body composition measurement, the subjects did not consume alcohol, drank no more than 2.5 l of water a day, had no contraindications to bioimpedance (cancer, edema, pacemaker, metal inserts—screws, bone plates), and did not undertake intense activity physical. the dermal fat folds of the thigh were measured using a harpenden. the study used the measurement of skin and fat folds at the thigh level. the measurement was taken vertically along the front of the thigh and in the middle of the thigh. the subject for measurement stood slightly apart on both legs. the measurement was performed sev-eral times on the dominant leg; the average measurement for each athlete was used for the calculations. in the study group, 63% had an adequate amount of body fat com-pared with the norms for men with moderate activity, and only 34% met the norms recommended for bodybuilders. the lowest content of adipose tissue was 10.2% and the highest was 27.2%. among the respondents, 43% met the norms of lean mass content for the average man, 26% of people had too little weight, and 31% too high. the mean value for a given group was 82.3%. there were 57% of men with a normal proportion of adipose tissue, and most of them (31%) had an increased lean mass. the mean content of the hydration of the subjects was 60.2% and is not within the normal range.
the statistica 13.1 package was used to analyze the 
obtained results. the mean value and sd for a given sample, as well as the minimum and maximum for each value, were determined. the rang spearman correlation was used to assess the knowledge about nutrition and protein consumption and the dependence of anthropo-metric values on the consumed protein. a significance level of p < .05 was assumed.

march 15, 2019. the research was carried out and financed as part of statutory research conducted as part of employ-ment university school physical education in wroclaw. the study was conducted in accordance with the princi-ples of the helsinki declaration. all participants gave written informed consent on the forms, after thoroughly explaining the procedures related to them.
results
on average, respondents in the nutritional interview con-sumed 1.8 g of protein/kg, with the highest recorded con-version rate of 3.7 g of protein/kg of body weight, and the lowest of 0.9 g/kg of body weight. total protein con-sumption was in the range of 70.2–295.7 g, and the aver -
age value was 147.8 g (22%). protein supplements provided 31% of protein on average (table 2).
all respondents indicated chicken and turkey as the 
main source of protein in the diet and 29 (83%) eggs. protein supplements are used as the basic basis in their daily diet by 20 men (57%). fish as a source of protein in their diet is used by only 14 (40%) respondents, and legumes are a source of protein for only five (14%) ath-letes. only 11 (31%) of the surveyed men control the caloric content of their diet, and 18 (51%) pay attention to the amount of protein they absorb from the diet. in 15 (42%) respondents, the quantitative values of protein consumed in the questionnaire were the same as those calculated on the basis of the diet presented by the ath-letes. to determine the protein in the diet, 19 (55%) men use a protein ratio of 1.5–2.0 g/kg body weight, six (17.5%) respondents use a protein ratio above 2.0 g/kg body weight, and six (17.5%) of the examined men use a protein ratio of 1–1.5 g/kg body weight. among the respondents declaring the use of a protein converter, only 10 (28%) agree with the 24-hr interview, and in the remaining 25 (72%), it differs in the protein content in the menu; 17 (49%) respondents overstate their indicator in daily consumption and eight (22%) understates. for the amateur athletes surveyed, protein is the most impor -
tant preworkout and postworkout nutrient. protein sup-plements are always consumed by 25 (71%) of the surveyed men before starting physical activity and by 18 (51%) before training but in the form of protein supple-ments. similar protein consumption statistics appeared in the question about nutrients or supplements consumed after training—27 (77%) of the surveyed men consumed protein nutritional products and 19 (51%) protein sup-plements. one after the other, all the surveyed men who train in the gym as an amateur arrange their own training plan and 29 (83%) use dietary supplementation. protein supplements are consumed by 26 (74%) respondents, while 17 (49%) respondents consumed carbohydrate supplements or bars or sports drinks or cocktails or vita-min and mineral preparations. on average, every fourth respondent consumed thermoregulatory slimming prepa-rations. only two (6%) used complex protein–carbohy-drate supplements. none of the respondents mentioned steroid supplements in the menu or in the survey. among those surveyed, 30 (86%) declare that they eat two or more nutrients at the same time, ignoring the duplication of certain supplements, which results in an even greater increase in protein intake during the day.
a statistically significant positive correlation was 
observed between the state of knowledge about nutrition and the amount of consumed protein (table 3).
an important element of individual control of the 
effectiveness of training are measurements of body com-position using the bioimpedance method (bia), as well table 2. protein in the analyzed per day menus along with norms for men doing bodybuilding.

as measurements of skin-fat folds made as part of the 
tests; the results obtained are presented in table 4.
on the basis of body composition studies, it was found 
that 12 (34%) subjects had the percentage of body fat in line with the norms for bodybuilders (6%–16%), and 22 (63%) were appropriate for men in this age range (15%–18%). the mean value of the total amount of water in the body (tbw) in the subjects was 60.2% and was within the normal range for men. in the case of athletes whose normative ffm value is higher than in nontraining ones and amounts to 89%–91%, the amount of tbw should be higher and amount to 65%–75%. among the respondents, only two (6%) had a tbw (>65%) correct for athletes but not more than 66.4%. when determining the relation-ship between the consumed protein and anthropometric values, spearman’s rank-order correlation was used. a statistically significant average correlation (strength of correlation according to the guilford scale) was observed between the consumed protein levels and the amount of total adipose tissue estimated by the bia method and thigh fatness using the measurement of skin and fat folds. the correlation results are presented in table 5.
there is a statistically significant positive correlation 
between the measures of skin-fat folds on the thigh and the amount of protein consumed by amateur bodybuild-ers, which means that a higher skinfold measure was associated with higher protein intake. the fat mass is influenced by the consumption of protein from supple-ments, and if the respondents consumed more protein from nutrients, their fat mass increased (table 5).
discussion
according to respondents, the most important nutrient is protein. the respondents base their diet on such sources of protein as meat with a predominance of poultry meat, eggs, dairy products, and protein supplements. panansiewicz and grochowicz (2016) in their studies on 50 bodybuild-ers obtained similar results in terms of dietary protein sources. among the respondents, 45% chose white meat (poultry), 31% red meat, and 24% eggs. such important sources of wholesome protein like legumes and fish, which are rich in branched-chain amino acids (bcaa), important in strength training due to increased muscle regeneration are consumed in minority. the amount of protein consumed by the surveyed men is completely dif-ferent than they actually consume. on the basis of dietary diaries, higher protein intake in the form of nutritional products and supplements was determined than in the survey responses, which proves the lack of ability to dis-tinguish the correct sources of protein. in this study, as in the study of wilczek et al. (2013), high energy supply from protein was observed, which amounted to 22%, which is not within the range indicated for amateur men practicing strength training. a daily protein requirement of 129–133 g is recommended for this study group, which gives 14% energy. there are still debates about the right amount of protein in the athlete’s diet. many specialists say that one should not increase the amount of protein in food as energy expenditure increases, but the amount of fats and carbohydrates (celejowa, 2008; jäger et al., 2017; jeszka, 2003; morton et al., 2018; thomas et al., 2016). however, many studies show the need to increase protein in sports nutrition (cermak et al., 2012; fillon 
et al., 2020; iraki et al., 2019; kreider and campbell, 2009; krysztofiak et al., 2012; potgieter, 2013). research conducted on polish trucks showed that the daily energy expenditure of competitors reaches 6000 kcal (25.10 mj) and proves that they should consume a minimum of 150 g/24 hr of protein, which gives 1.9 g/kg body weight (kerksick et al., 2013). then the criterion with a protein energy value of 10% would be met, and most authors rec-ommend consuming 15% protein from food energy. in this case, it would be 900 kcal (4.37 mj), or 225 g pro-tein/24 hr, that is, 2.8 g/kg (cermak et al., 2012; iraki 
et al., 2019; kreider and campbell, 2009; krysztofiak et al., 2012; potgieter, 2013).
the nitrogen balance indicates the degree of coverage 
of protein demand and is a relation of assimilated to excreted nitrogen. the correct nitrogen balance should be in equilibrium. a negative or positive balance indicates table 4. average values of fat folds and body composition component in the tested amateur bodybuilders.

too little or too large protein take. irregularities may also 
result from the body’s nitrogen retention when stored for muscle renewal and growth, as well as increased amino acid utilization for energy purposes. nitrogen retention is a natural phenomenon observed in professional athletes, and phenomena such as exfoliation, breathing, and sweat-ing affect the maintenance of normal nitrogen balance. according to fao/who experts, nitrogen loss with sweat can reach 3.8 g/24 hr, while other studies even indi-cate a rate of 3.1–9.1 g/24 hr. on average, the correlation is 6.25 g of protein/g of nitrogen, and hence it would amount to 19.4–56.6 g of protein equivalent. it turns out that there is a relationship between the nitrogen loss with sweat and energy expenditure and the amount of sweat released. this conclusion was reached by a group of sci-entists after carrying out research on the olympic team of weightlifters (giannopoulou et al., 2013). it is very important that in the case of low-intensity or moderate-intensity exercises (<50 vo² max), no significant increase in protein demand has been proven (frączek et al., 2019) and it is within 0.8–1.2 g protein/kg of body weight per day. extreme athletes should consume 1.8–2.2 g protein/kg body weight daily. in 1991, in lausanne, consensus found that the average protein requirement for sports was 1.4–1.9 g/kg (cermak et al., 2012; iraki et al., 
2019; kreider and campbell, 2009; krysztofiak et al., 2012; potgieter, 2013). a balanced nitrogen balance gives us information about the correct use of the consumed pro-teins. it also allows us to determine the amount of protein demand depending on the intensity of physical effort. the paper presents research on this method as a way to indi-vidualize an athlete’s diet. this is important information because the amount of protein demand depends on the intensity of physical effort.
concluding, the use of a larger supply of protein is 
justified for professional and competitive bodybuilders, due to a large degradation of muscle fibers through enor -
mous effort loads; however, it is not justified for casual and amateur bodybuilders. studies indicate that such action does not enhance the effects and may promote the development of osteoporosis, hypertension, kidney dis-ease, and strain the cardiovascular system (cermak et al., 2012; kwaśniewska, 2011; te morenga and mann, 2012). analyzing the patient’s case, guardia et al. concluded 
that prolonged oversupply of protein may lead to dys-function of the intestinal mucosa (della guardia et al., 2015). in the intestinal lumen, food protein (amino acids) can be metabolized by microflora to ammonia and short-chain fatty acids. ammonia (at millimolar concentra-tions) is likely to interfere with the metabolism of colon epithelial cells, thus disrupting physiological processes (andriamihaja et al., 2010; conlon and bird, 2014; cremin et al., 2003; michalska et al., 2016).in the world, 40% to over 88% of people practicing 
sports use supplements and nutrients for athletes (petróczi et al., 2008; williams, 2008). thirty-seven percent of men who do strength training take nutritional supple-ments because it is common and fashionable, without believing in any effects. the main motive for using sup-plements in surveyed men undertaking weight training is to improve the appearance of their figure and increase maximum power and muscle strength, that is, improving athletic performance (kerksick et al., 2013; wilczek et al., 2013). the motive of 46% of people was to supple-ment the diet, despite most amateur bodybuilders had numerous nutrient deficiencies. this condition is the result of acquiring knowledge from unreliable sources and the lack of consultation with a dietitian or doctor. the most common erogenous agent used by amateur body-builders is protein preparations (bcaa, creatinine). similar results were obtained by other researchers ana-lyzing in their works the popularity of nutrients among active people (frączek and grzelak, 2012; górska-kłęk et al., 2008; kerksick et al., 2013; krejpcio et al., 2011; skop-lewandowska et al., 2013). men chose supple-ments without referring to the australian institute of sport, which identifies supplements with proven support-ive effect (rodriguez et al., 2009).
protein aides are very popular among the studied 
group and are used by up to 74% of amateur bodybuilders declaring the use of supplementation. it happens more and more often that the amount of protein preparations taken is inadequate to the demand. in their research, chappell et al. (2019) showed that amateur bodybuilders do not follow the recommended guidelines, especially in the preparation period for the competition. in their research, they observed that a short period of supplemen-tation, used by amateurs, especially with increased pro-tein dosing, gives less positive results than the long-term one used by professionals—bodybuilders, in accordance with dietary recommendations (chappell et al., 2019). protein-based supplements may contain as a protein source: whey, casein, soy, or eggs. the most popular is whey protein, which has a higher biological value than milk, is digested and absorbed fairly quickly, which helps in postworkout regeneration. in addition, it has a higher content of exogenous amino acids including bcaa. casein is absorbed more slowly than whey and also has a high concentration of bcaa as well as glutamine and arginine (gawęcki and mossor-pietraszewska, 2005). proper selection of protein preparations is very impor -
tant. whey protein hydrolysates, like easily digestible amino acids connected by peptide bonds, are suitable as regenerative products after training. preparations that are not subject to full digestion, with a full set of amino acids are absorbed faster from the cryovascular system into the karpik et al. 7
muscle cells, should be used in the preworkout period. 
the most important during training, however, are bcaa, necessary for building and rebuilding muscle proteins. they are an energy substrate that counteracts the destruc-tion of muscle tissue after depletion of muscle glycogen (kurylas et al., 2017). kurylas et al. in her research, observed that 80% of the surveyed bodybuilders take bcaa products, but only 20% of them notice positive results of supplementation (kurylas et al., 2017). such a low percentage of people satisfied with the effects of using protein preparations may be affected by the compo-sition of these supplements. most of the protein prepara-tions also contain carbohydrates, most often sugar or stevia glycosides. by using this product, athletes only control the level of protein, not carbohydrates, which may be the basis for the lack of the expected results. ribeiro et al. (2019) emphasize in their research that 
professional bodybuilders may use higher doses of pro-tein than recommended because they are controlled by nutritionists, and amateurs should follow general rec-ommendations. the most commonly used high-protein preparations among amateurs is creatinine (frączek and grzelak, 2012; krejpcio et al., 2011; kurylas et al., 2019). protein preparations should be consumed separately from consumed protein products, that is, between meals. the only exception to this rule is when the protein preparation is to replace protein products in a postworkout meal (frączek et al., 2019).
one of the most important aspects of the study is the 
fact that the average bmi of the study group was above normal. this phenomenon may be due to the increased lean body mass of most amateur bodybuilders studied, caused by an increase in muscularity, or an increased per -
centage of body fat that occurred in 43% of people sur -
veyed and may be due to excessive protein quantities in the diet and incorrect supplementation.
this and other studies have exposed a limited dietary 
and nutritional and supplementation products knowledge of amateur men undertaking strength training, proving a strong indication for a revision of the educational pro-gram, with the emphasis put on the sportspeople in regard to nutrition and dietary supplements, and their safe use (frączek and grzelak, 2012; kerksick et al., 2013; krejpcio et al., 2011; skop-lewandowska et al., 2013). lack of knowledge about proper nutrition and supple-mentation during physical activity is not only a problem of this research. wilczek et al. in their research on a group of 99 amateur athletes stated that 60% of them use sup-plementation by introducing at least 3–4, some up to 10 products during training (wilczek et al., 2013).
at the same time, michalska et al. (2016) and 
wilczek et al. (2013) emphasize that the lack of knowl-edge about proper nutrition, excessive concentration on one’s own appearance, and striving for a perfect appearance according to men may lead to nonspecific eating disorders of bigorexia or orthorexia (michalska et al., 2016; wilczek et al., 2013). most of the authors dealing with dietary supplementation among bodybuild-ers emphasize that the respondents independently make decisions about supplements to the diet. amateurs com-bine different products without controlling the recom-mended amount of protein and supplements, most often controlling only the content of amino acids in the supple-ment (chappell et al., 2019; frączek and grzelak, 2012; 
kerksick et al., 2013; krejpcio et al., 2011; kurylas et al., 2019; michalska et al., 2016; ribeiro et al., 2019; skop-lewandowska et al., 2013; wilczek et al., 2013).
the presented research, like any questionnaire study 
based on the written record by the respondent, has certain limitations. the results are based on the subjective assess-ment made by the respondent and his reliability in esti-mating the consumed products. at the same time, the study group was interested in their health and deepened their knowledge about proper nutrition and training. in order to make a complete objective assessment of the diet and training in the study group, it is necessary to isolate the subjects for the training period and apply full moni-toring of the consumed products; however, it is not fea-sible in the case of amateur athletes, because apart from practicing sports, they lead an independent life. to mini-mize the possibility of errors in the dietary record, a full oral and written instruction was conducted on how to fill in the food diary, and in the event of problems, the sub-jects could contact a dietitian from the research team.
the problem of dietary supplementation requires fur -
ther research and determination of the standards for the use of individual nutrients. in the present day, with the wide availability of information, precise recommenda-tions supported by research and scientific authority are needed.
conclusions
the basic problem that can be noticed in the studied group of men practicing strength sports is the lack of pro-fessionalism in the field of diet. this is reflected in improper dietary supplementation and inadequate adjust-ment of the amount of nutrients, in particular protein, to the needs. mistakes made by athletes can be observed in abnormalities in body composition, such as a reduced amount of tbw in relation to gender norms, an increased amount of fm compared with the norms for athletes and, consequently, a reduced amount of ffm. it is disturbing that almost 2/3 of the surveyed men aged 18–35 used dietary supplementation with nutrients without prior con-trol of the level of their intake with the diet. amateur bodybuilders have taken several supplements simultane-ously, often with the same nutrients, for example, bcaas 8 american journal of men’s health 
with protein supplements, leading to excess intake. the 
use of supplements for athletes in the group of people training amateur in the gym is a common phenomenon, despite the lack of knowledge in this field. the conducted study showed a strong need to popularize an educational program on nutrition and dietary supplements and their safe use, aimed at people practicing physical activity.

introduction
sport and exercise performance are significantly influenced by nutrition, yet individuals respond
differently to the same foods, nutrients and supplements consumed. this holds true for a variety

and take into account specificity and uniqueness of responses t o various strategies” ( 1). these

while it has long been recognized that genetics play an influen tial role in determiningguest et al. sport nutrigenomics

research into gene-diet interactions over the past decade ha s
provided a scientific basis for this hypothesis through variou s

motivation in general ( 7), nutrition professionals still encounter
significant barriers to behavior change when counseling ath letes
on the adoption of beneficial sports nutrition practices ( 8,
9). a recent systematic review found that when genetic
information included actionable advice, individuals were m ore
likely to change health behaviors, including their dietary choices
andintakes( 10).
the practical application of the scientific knowledge gained
from research on health and performance is to enable athletes
to utilize genetic test results for personalized nutrition i n
an actionable manner. the demand for genetic testing for
personalized nutrition and associated performance outcomes
by athletes and active individuals is growing, and there is a n
increased need for dietitian-nutritionists, fitness profes sionals,
coaches, and other sports medicine practitioners to understa nd

growing body of science in nutrition and genetics is the
foundational building block by which practitioners can help
athletes reach their genetic potential through implementati on
of dietary and supplement strategies that are aligned to their
genetic makeup ( figure1). scientific advancements along with
increased interest in genetic testing have resulted in a nec essary
growth for professional support, where tools for proficient and
knowledgeable nutrition counseling based on genetics are n ow
more widely available. for example, the dietitians of canada
now offer a course on “nutrigenomics: genetic testing for
personalized nutrition” as part of their online learning-on-
demandportal.
personalized nutrition, based on an individual’s genotype, is
not a novel concept, and there are several examples of rare (e.g. ,
phenylketonuria)andcommon(e.g.,lactoseintolerance)genet ic
variants that require specific dietary strategies to manage ( 15).

with the exception of investigations exploring genetic
variation and supplemental caffeine, which have been shown
to modify endurance exercise outcomes ( 19,20), there are few
performance studies that have examined the role of genetics
and other dietary factors on athletic outcomes. a gene-diet
interaction may not be associated directly with a quantifiab le
performance outcome, such as increased aerobic capacity,
speed or strength, but rather with intermediate biomarkers o r
phenotypes, such as body composition or circulating vitamin
d levels, which are independent determinants of athletic
performance, injury-risk and post-training recovery ( 1,21–
24). for example, it is well-known that low iron stores
impact hemoglobin production which in turn decreases the
oxygen carrying capacity of the blood, leading to a lack of
oxygen to working muscles and resulting in impaired muscle
contractionandaerobicendurance( 21).assuch,geneticmarkers
that impact iron stores in response to intake can indirectly
affect performance through the oxygen carrying capacity of
hemoglobin( 25,26).
sport nutrigenomics vs. talent
identification and exercise prescription
in an effort to achieve specific sport goals, there is generally
considerable overlap in the development of complementary
training and dietary plans for athletes ( 27–29). however, it is
essential to underscore the distinction between the streng th
of evidence supporting dna-based advice for personalized
nutrition vs. that for fitness programming. despite the ferven t
interest and ubiquity of commercial genetic testing to asse ss
and improve exercise or sport performance ( 30–32), it should
be noted that there is a lack of evidence encompassing exercis e
prescription and talent identification, such as the ability to
predict the likelihood for the next generation of olympians
(33,34). similarly, at this time there is insufficient evidence to
recommended training protocols (strength or endurance) bas ed
on genotype or polygenic scores, that target specific fitness,
weight loss or sport goals ( 35–38). the practical and ethicalconsiderationsofgenetictestingforsportsperformancehav ealso
beendescribed( 39).
some commercial genetic tests claim to use proprietary
algorithmic approaches to prescribe training protocols based o n
evidence reported in peer-reviewed research ( 35). although this
mayprovidesomeinitialsupportivedocumentationfordiffering
responses to training based on genotype, much larger sample
sizes and improved methodologies are required, and should be
pursued( 36).theapproachbywhichindividualsarecategorized
as having an “endurance” or “power” advantage by genotype or
being “responders” and “non-responders” to different training
protocols, requires transparency and standardization acros s the
field to avoid potential bias and to allow other researchers
to replicate a study’s methodology ( 37). attempts to replicate
studies to test training outcomes based on genotype require
the use of the identical scoring systems and it appears that
essential details of methods for grading of the strength of
scientific evidence used in these scoring systems are not
reported( 35).
there is a considerable amount of ongoing research
investigatingindividualvariationinresponsetoexerciset raining,
however, sport and exercise genomics is still in its early stag es
and clinical or sport utility is lacking ( 36,40–44). mainstream
testing for personalized training or exercise prescription bas ed
on genotype is not currently supported as a scientifically-soun d
approach, although it is likely to be a common and viably
employedcoachingtoolwithinthenextdecade( 35–37,43,44).

appear to be partly due, to variation in genes such as cyp1a2
and possibly adora2 , which are associated with caffeine
metabolism,sensitivityandresponse( 51).
over 95% of caffeine is metabolized by the cyp1a2 enzyme,
which is encoded by the cyp1a2 gene (52). the−163a>c
(rs762551) single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) has been
shown to alter cyp1a2 enzyme activity ( 53–55), and has been
used to identify individuals as “fast” or “slow” metabolize rs
of caffeine. individuals who are considered slow metabolizer s,
that is with the ac or cc genotype, have an elevated
risk of myocardial infarction ( 56), hypertension and elevated
blood pressure ( 57,58), and pre-diabetes ( 59), with increasing
caffeinated coffee consumption, whereas those with the aa
genotype(fastmetabolizers)donotappeartocarrytheserisks .
the largest caffeineand exercise study to date ( 19), examined
the effects of caffeine and cyp1a2genotype, on 10-km cycling
time trial performance in competitive male athletes after
ingestion of caffeine at 0mg, 2mg (low dose) or 4mg (moderate
dose) per kg body mass. there was a 3% improvement in
cycling time in the moderate dose in all subjects, which is
consistent with previous cycling time trial studies using si milar
doses (46,60). however, there was a significant caffeine-gene
interaction where improvements in performance were seen at
both caffeine doses, but only in those with the aa genotype
who are “fast metabolizers” of caffeine. in that group, a 6.8%
improvement in cycling time was observed at 4 mg/kg, which
is>2–4% mean improvement seen in several other cycling time
trial studies, using similar doses ( 46,60–65). among those with
the cc genotype, 4 mg/kg caffeine impaired performance by
13.7%, and in those with the ac genotype there was no effect
of either caffeine dose ( 19). the findings are consistent with a
previous study ( 20), which observed a caffeine-gene interaction
and improved time trial cycling performance with caffeine only
inthosewiththeaagenotype.
some previous endurance-type studies either did not observe
any impact of the cyp1a2 gene on caffeine-exercise studies
(66,67), or reported benefits only in slow metabolizers ( 45).
there are several reasons that may explain discrepancies in
study outcomes including smaller sample sizes ( <20 subjects)
that cause very low numbers and/or no subjects with the cc
genotype ( 45,67,68), and shorter distance or different type
(power vs. endurance) of performance test ( 45), compared to
those that reported improved endurance after caffeine ingestio n
in those with the aa genotype of cyp1a2(19,20). the effects
of genotype on performance appear to be most prominent
during exercise of longer duration or an accumulation of fat igue
(aerobicormuscularendurance)( 69,70).fastmetabolizersmay
quickly metabolize caffeine and achieve the benefits of caffeine
metabolitesasexerciseprogresses,oroverridetheshortdu ration
of negative impacts (the initial stages of exercise), wherea s the
adverse effects of restricted blood flow and/or other impacts of
adenosine blockage in slow metabolizers are likely to remai n
for a longer duration ( 71,72). indeed, in a study of basketball
performance in elite players, caffeine improved repeated jumps
(muscular endurance; an accumulation of fatigue), but only in
those with the aa genotype, however, there was no genotype
effectintheothertwoperformancecomponentsofthebasketballsimulation ( 73). similarly, a cross-over design of 30 resistance-
trained men found that caffeine ingestion resulted in a higher

and for total repetitions in all resistance exercises combined ,

taken together, the weight of the evidence supports the role of
cyp1a2inmodifyingtheeffectsofcaffeineingestiononaerobic
ormuscularendurance-typeexercise.
theadora2a gene is another potential genetic modifier
of the effects of caffeine on performance. the adenosine a 2a
receptor, encoded by the adora2a gene, has been shown to
regulate myocardial oxygen demand and increase coronary
circulation by vasodilation ( 71,72). the a 2areceptor is
also expressed in the brain, where it regulates glutamate and
dopamine release, with associated effects on insomnia and
pain (75,76). the antagonism of adenosine receptors by
caffeinecoulddifferby adora2a genotype,resultinginaltered
dopamine signaling ( 51). dopamine has been associated with
motivation and effort in exercising individuals, and this may b e
a mechanism by which differences in response to caffeine are
manifested( 77–79).
one small pilot study has examined the effect of adora2a
genotype (rs5751876) on the ergogenic effects of caffeine under
exercise conditions ( 80). twelve female subjects underwent a
double-blinded, crossover trial comprising two 10-min cycli ng
time trials following caffeine ingestion or placebo. caffeine
benefitted all six subjects with the tt genotype but only one
of the six c allele carriers. further studies are needed to
confirm these preliminary findings and include a larger sample
to distinguish any effects between the different c allele carrie rs
(i.e.,ctvs.ccgenotypes).
sleepisrecognizedasanessentialcomponentofphysiological
and psychological recovery from, and preparation for, high-
intensity training in athletes ( 81,82). theadora2a rs5751876
genotype has also been implicated, by both objective and
subjective measures, in various parameters of sleep quality
after caffeine ingestion in several studies ( 83–86). adenosine
promotes sleep by binding to its receptors in the brain, mainly
a1and a2areceptors, and caffeine reverses these effects by
blocking the adenosine receptor, which promotes wakefulness
(83). this action, as well as the potency of caffeine to restore
performance (cognitive or physical) in ecological situations ,
such as highway-driving during the night ( 87), support the
notion that the adenosine neuromodulator/receptor system
plays a major role in sleep–wake regulation. this action of
caffeine may also serve athletes well under conditions of
jetlag, and irregular or early training or competition schedu les.
psychomotor speed relies on the ability to respond, rapidly
and reliably, to randomly occurring stimuli which is a criti cal
component of most sports ( 88). genetic variation in adora2a
has been shown to be a relevant determinant of psychomotor
vigilance in the rested and sleep-deprived state and modulate s
individual responses to caffeine after sleep deprivation ( 85).
in support of this notion, individuals who had the tt
genotype for adora2a rs5751876 consistently had faster
response times (in seconds) than c allele carriers after inge sting

vitamin a
no studies have examined the role of genetic modifiers of
vitamin a status directly on athletic performance, however,
there are several important functions of this micronutrient that
are associated with optimal health, immunity and performance
inathletes.
vitamin a is a fat-soluble vitamin, which plays a key role
in both vision ( 92) and immunity ( 93) in its biologically
active forms (retinal and retinoic acid). vitamin a has dive rse
immunemodulatoryroles;hence,vitaminadeficiencyhasbee n
associatedwithbothimmunedysfunctionsinthegut,andsev eral
systemic immune disorders ( 93). vitamin a is also a powerful
antioxidant, protecting eyes from ocular diseases and helpin g to
maintainvision( 92).
high-performance athletes appear to have superior visual
abilities based on their capacity to access distinct visual s kills,
such as contrast sensitivity, dynamic acuity, stereoacuit y, and
ocular judgment, needed to accomplish interceptive actions
(e.g., hand-eye coordination) and resolve fine spatial detai l,
which is required by many sports ( 94,95). in addition,
slow visuomotor reaction time (vmrt) has been associated
with musculoskeletal injury risk in sporting situations whe re
there are greater challenges to visual stimulus detection a nd
motor response execution ( 96). these visuomotor skills are key
contributors to enhanced sport performance, and accordingly ,
requireexceptionaleyehealth.
deficiencies of certain micronutrients such as vitamin a
decrease immune defense against invading pathogens and can
cause the athlete to be more susceptible to infection. low
energy availability (dieting), poor food choices, jetlag, ph ysical
and psychological stress, and exposure to pollution and foreig n
pathogens in air, food and water while traveling can result in a
deterioration in immune function and increased susceptibil ity
to illness ( 97). athletes following high volume, high intensity
trainingandcompetitionschedulesarealsoknowntohavemor e
frequent upper respiratory tract infections (urti) compared to
bothsedentaryandmoderatelyexercisingpopulations( 97).
upon absorption, provitamin a carotenoids are readily
converted to vitamin a by the bcmo1 enzyme expressed inenterocytes of the intestinal mucosa ( 98).β-carotene is the
most abundant provitamin a carotenoid in the diet and the
conversionofbeta-carotenetoretinalorretinoicacidisn ecessary
for vitamin a to exert its biological functions. the rs116454 28
variantinthe bcmo1geneaffectscirculatingplasmacarotenoid
levels by impacting the conversion of dietary provitamin a
carotenoids to active forms of vitamin a in the small intesti ne
(99). individuals with the gg genotype are inefficient at this
conversion, and may be at higher risk for vitamin a deficiency
(100).theseindividualsareconsideredlowresponderstodietary
β-carotene so consuming enough dietary pre-formed vitamin a
(or supplements for vegans), can help to ensure that circulating
levels of active vitamin a are adequate to support vision,
immunityandnormalgrowthanddevelopment.
anemia-related micronutrients: iron,
folate, and vitamin b 12
there is an abundance of research demonstrating the adverse
effects of low iron storage and anemia on athletic performance
(23,101–103). the estimated prevalence of anemias and low
levels of iron, folate, and vitamin b 12appear to be higher
in elite-level athletes than in the general population, and
these deficiencies can have significant negative impacts on
performance ( 22,23,104–107). the most common symptoms
of this disorder are fatigue, weakness and, in extreme cases ,
shortnessofbreathorpalpitations( 103).
the importance of iron to athletes is established through
its biological role in supporting the function of proteins
and enzymes essential for maintaining physical and cognitive
performance ( 108). iron is incorporated into hemoglobin and
myoglobin, proteins responsible for the transport and storage
of oxygen. iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of
anemia among athletes, who have higher iron requirements du e
to increased erythropoietic drive through higher intensiti es and
volumes of training. the female athlete is at particular risk of
iron deficiency due to menstruation and generally, a lower to tal
energy or food intake compared to males ( 107,109). along with
dietary intake, footstrike hemolysis, gastrointestinal bl eeding,
exercise-inducedinflammation,non-steroidalautoinflamm atory
drug (nsaid) use and environmental factors such as hypoxia
(altitude), may influence iron metabolism in athletes of both
sexes (23). macrocytic anemias, which occur when erythrocytes
arelargerthannormal,aregenerallyclassifiedintomegalobl astic
or nonmegaloblastic anemia. megaloblastic anemia is caused
by deficiency or impaired utilization of vitamin b 12and/or
folate, whereas non-megaloblastic macrocytic anemia is ca used
by various diseases, and will not be discussed here ( 110). other
factors that are associated with anemia risk include geneti c
variation, which can alter micronutrient metabolism, transpo rt
or absorption, and can be used to identify individuals at risk o f
inadequatelevelsofvitaminb 12,folateandironstores.
performance improvements are usually seen with the
treatment of anemia ( 23,103,104), which is related to
improvements in symptoms such as general feelings of fatigue
and weakness, difficulty exercising, and in more severe cases,
dyspnea and palpitations ( 103). hyperhomocysteinemia, which
frontiers in nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 6 february 2019 | volume 6 | article 8guest et al. sport nutrigenomics
can result from low folate and/or vitamin b 12intake, may
also increase the risk of skeletal muscle malfunction, incl uding
muscleweaknessandmuscleregeneration,andwillbediscuss ed
furtherbelow( 111).
folate
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (mthfr) is the rate-
limiting enzyme in the methyl cycle, and is encoded by the
mthfrgene (112). the c677t (rs1801133) polymorphism in
themthfrgene has been associated with low serum and red
blood cell folate as well as elevated plasma homocysteine lev els,
which is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disea se
(cvd) (113,114). several studies in athletic and non-athletic
populations have shown that individuals with the ct or tt
genotype are at an increased risk of low circulating folate le vels
whentheirdietislowinfolate( 115–118).
although there are no studies examining performance
outcomes related to mthfrgenotypes or dietary folate intake,
hyperhomocysteinemia has been shown to be associated with
diminished muscle function ( 111). several studies conducted
in older adults have found a significant association between
elevated plasma homocysteine concentrations and declined
physical function ( 119–122), which may be mediated by a
reduction in strength ( 120). compared to those with the
rs1801133 cc genotype, individuals with tt genotype and
possibly the ct genotype may be at a greater risk for
hyperhomocysteinemia, although this may not be causative fo r
lower physical performance ( 111,119,120). however, soccer
players and sedentary individuals with the cc genotype have
been shown to have more favorable body composition and
performance measures such as aerobic and anaerobic threshol d
rates,comparedtocarriersofthetallele( 118).
iron overload
genetic variation associated with serum iron levels involv es
several genes such as hfe, tmprss6, tfr2 , andtf(25,
117,123–128). thehfegene is involved in the regulation
of intestinal iron uptake ( 129), and variations in this gene,
which are not very common, have been shown to increase
the risk for hemochromatosis or iron overload ( 124,130).
excess iron may be toxic to tissues and cells because highly
reactive “free” iron reacts with reactive oxygen species (ros )
such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxides, or lipid peroxides
to produce free radicals ( 131). in turn, these free radicals
can cause cell and tissue damage (including muscle) and,
ultimately, lead to cell death ( 132). elevated biomarkers of
iron such as ferritin and transferrin are more common in
those who are genetically predisposed to iron overload based
on thehfegene variant ( 22,124). interestingly, athletes with
the rare hfe(rs1800562) aa genotype, which is associated
with an increased risk for hemochromatosis, may be at a
genetic advantage to excel in sport if iron levels are at
the high end of the normal range, but not excessive to
cause tissue damage. notably, several studies have found th at
certain variants of the hfegene that increase risk of iron
overload are more common in elite-level athletes compared tothe general population, suggesting this may be beneficial for
performance( 133–135).
two snps in the hfegene (rs1800562 and rs1799945)
can be used to predict risk of hereditary hemochromatosis.
based on the combination of variants from these two snps,
individuals can be categorized as having a high, medium, or
low risk for iron overload ( 124,128). while genetic risk for
iron overload may have a favorable impact on performance, it is
necessary for athletes with a medium or high risk to avoid iro n
supplementation as this could lead to adverse health outcomes
(124)anddiminishedperformance.
low iron status
three main snps: tmprss6 (rs4820268), tfr2(rs7385804),
tf(rs3811647) can be used to assess genetic risk for low
iron status, primarily due to their involvement in regulating
the expression of hepcidin, which is a peptide hormone that
controls iron absorption ( 25,123,127). iron-deficiency anemia
impairs performance by reducing oxygen-carrying capacity, bu t
anumberofreportsindicatethatirondeficiencywithoutanem ia
may affect physiological performance and work capacity as well
(21),particularlyinwomenwhoexperienceirondeficiencymore
frequently( 22,23).
there is a fine balance in achieving and maintaining
adequate,butnotexcessive,ironlevelsforoptimalperforma nce.
individuals with the gg genotype in the tmprss6 gene have
an increased risk of low transferrin saturation and hemoglo bin,
compared to those who are carriers of the a allele ( 25,26,
123,136). in the tfgene, individuals have a greater risk for
low ferritin and elevated transferrin when they possess the a a
genotype ( 25,123,136). variation in the tfr2gene can impact
hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, and red blood cell count
where individuals with the cc genotype have an increased risk
of low serum levels ( 25). utilizing algorithms to assess various
genotype combinations, these genes can help to determine an
individual’s overall risk for low iron status, which can lead
to iron-deficiency anemia, and can be used to target dietary
iron intake. although iron supplementation is common and
frequently prescribed in athletes, many individuals are at r isk
of taking iron supplements in excess ( 22,137,138). although
iron supplements are commonly “prescribed” by healthcare
professionals and nutritionists ( 139,140), excess iron stored in
skeletal muscle may not only be dangerous to the health of
the athlete ( 124,141), but also can lead to oxidative stress and
the formation of free radicals, and reduced athletic performa nce
(135,142,143).
vitamin b 12
vitamin b 12is also associated with rbc formation and
aerobic capacity. megaloblastic anemia results from vitamin b12
deficiency and is associated with elevated homocysteine, an d
resultsingeneralfeelingsoffatigueandweakness.megalob lastic
anemialimitstheblood’soxygencarryingcapacity,thusred ucing
its availability to cells ( 144). variation in the fut2gene
(rs602662) has a significant impact on serum b 12levels where
individuals with gg or ga genotypes possess the greatest risk
for low serum vitamin b 12levels, but only when the diet is low
frontiers in nutrition | www.frontiersin.org 7 february 2019 | volume 6 | article 8guest et al. sport nutrigenomics
in bioavailable sources of vitamin b 12(145). this is consistent
with previous genome-wide association studies, which found
that individuals with the aa genotype had significantly highe r
concentrationsofserumvitaminb 12comparedtocarriersofthe
gallele(145).
vitamin c
vitamin c is a water-soluble antioxidant that aids in the
reductionofexercise-inducedfree-radicalproduction( 146).the
production of potentially harmful ros ( 147–149) in athletes is
greater than in non-athletes due to the massive increases (u p to
200-fold at the level of skeletal muscle) in oxygen consumpti on
duringstrenuousexercise( 146,150).vitamincsupplementation
was once thought to mitigate this risk; however, studies hav e
shownthatexcessvitamincsupplementationduringendurance
training can blunt beneficial training-induced physiologic al
adaptations,suchasmuscleoxidativecapacityandmitochond rial
biogenesis and may actually diminish performance ( 148,149,
151,152).dietaryconsumptionofvitaminc,upto250mgdaily
from fruits and vegetables, is likely sufficient to reduce oxi dative
stresswithouthavinganegativeeffectonperformance( 151,153).
additionally, collagen is a key constituent of connective t issue
such as tendons and ligaments, and vitamin c is necessary
for collagen production. this suggests that vitamin c may
play a role in muscle growth and repair ( 154,155). indeed, a
recent landmark study examining collagen synthesis in athl etes,
reported that adding a gelatin and vitamin c supplement to an
intermittent exercise protocol improves collagen synthesis and
could play a beneficial role in injury prevention and accelerat e
musculoskeletal,ligament,and/ortendontissuerepair( 155).

than those who meet the rda, but this effect is much greater in
individualswiththe gstt1del/delgenotypethanthosewiththe

genetictestingcanhelptoidentifyathleteswhomaybeatth e
greatest risk of low circulating vitamin c (ascorbic acid) l evels

may, in turn, diminish performance through an increased risk

althoughstudieshaveidentifiedassociationsbetweencirc ulating
ascorbicacidconcentrationsandvitaminctransporters,sv ct1
andsvct 2,whichareencodedby slc23a1 andslc23a2 (157),
there is no evidence that response to vitamin c intake differs
by genotype ( 158). as such, the use of variants in slc23a1 and
slc23a2 to make personalized dietary recommendations is not
supportedbythestudiestodate.
vitamin d
there are no studies that link genetic modifiers of vitamin
d status on athletic performance outcomes; however, there
are several functions of this vitamin that are associated wi th
bone health, immunity, recovery from training and variousperformance variables. genetic determinants of circulatin g 25-
hydroxyvitamind(25(oh)d)caninfluenceeachofthesefacto rs
therebyinfluencingperformance.
vitamin d is essential to calcium metabolism, increasing
calcium absorption for optimal bone health ( 1), which is
relevant to all athletes, but particularly those participatin g in
sports with a high risk of stress fracture ( 159–161). research
comparing individuals with sufficient levels to insufficient or
deficient levels of 25(oh)d has shown that it helps to prevent
injury (159–161), promote larger type ii muscle fiber size ( 24),
reduce inflammation ( 162), reduce risk of acute respiratory
illness(159,160)enhancefunctionalrehabilitation( 162),thereby
optimizing recovery and acute adaptive responses to intense
trainingthroughreducedinflammationandincreasedbloodfl ow
(163,164).
two genes that have been shown to impact vitamin d
status are the gcgene and the cyp2r1 gene (165,166).
variations in the gcandcyp2r1 genes are associated with
a greater risk for low serum 25(oh)d. in one study ( 165),
where 50% of participants took vitamin d supplements, only
22% of the participants had sufficient serum 25(oh)d levels.
in the remaining 78% who had insufficient levels, also only
about half (47%) took vitamin d supplements. within this
population, vitamin d supplementation only explained 18%
of the variation, compared to 30% from genetics, suggesting
that genetics may play a greater role than supplementation
in determining risk for low 25(oh)d levels ( 165). out of
the four genotypes analyzed, only cyp2r1 (rs10741657) and
gc(rs2282679) were significantly associated with vitamin d
status. specifically, participants with the gg or ga genotype of
cyp2r1(rs10741657)werenearlyfourtimesmorelikelytohave
insufficient vitamin d levels. those with the gg genotype of
thegcgene (rs2282679) were significantly more likely to have
low vitamin d levels compared to those with the tt genotype
(165). these results were consistent with findings from previous
studies,includingthestudyofunderlyinggeneticdetermin ants
of vitamin d and highly related traits (sunlight), which
found significance on a genome-wide basis in 15 cohorts with
over30,000participantsbetweenthreegeneticvariantsincl uding
cyp2r1(rs10741657) and gc(rs2282679) on vitamin d status.
notsurprisingly,thenumberofriskvariantsthatthepartici pants
possessed was directly related to their risk for vitamin d
insufficiency ( 166). these findings demonstrate that genetic
variation may be more impactful than supplementation intakes
andbehaviorsondeterminingriskforvitamindinsufficiency .
calcium
although studies linking calcium intake, genetics and bone
fracture has not been conducted in athletes specifically, gen etic
variation as it relates to risk of calcium deficiency and frac ture
risk have been studied in a large cohort of individuals, desc ribed
below (167). calcium is necessary for growth, maintenance and
repair of bone tissue and impacts maintenance of blood calcium
levels, regulation of muscle contraction, nerve conductio n, and
normalbloodclotting( 168).inordertoabsorbcalcium,adequate
vitamin d intake is also necessary. inadequate dietary calc ium

findings suggest that calcium intake recommendations could be

choline
choline was officially recognized as an essential nutrient
by the institute of medicine (iom) in 1998 ( 173). choline
plays a central role in many physiological pathways including
neurotransmitter synthesis (acetylcholine), cell-membr ane
signaling(phospholipids),bileandlipidtransport(lipoprotein s),
and methyl-group metabolism (homocysteine reduction) ( 174).
human requirements for choline are dependent on gender,
age and physical activity level as well as genetics. choline i s
produced in the body in small amounts, however, de novo
synthesis of choline alone is not sufficient to meet human
requirements for optimal health ( 174,175). the liver and
muscles are the major organs for methyl group metabolism,
and choline deficiency has been shown to cause both liver
and muscle damage ( 176,177). signs of choline deficiency
are identified through elevated serum creatine phosphokinase
(cpk), a marker of muscle damage ( 178,179), and abnormal
deposition of fat in the liver, which may result in non-alcoho lic
fatty liver disease (nafld) ( 176,180). reductions in plasma
cholineassociatedwithstrenuousexercisesuchastriathl onsand
marathonrunninghavebeenreported( 181,182).acetylcholine,
aneurotransmitterinvolvedinlearning,memory,andatten tion,
depends on adequate choline and a reduction in the release
of this neurotransmitter may contribute to the development
of fatigue and exercise performance impairment ( 181–183).
choline supplementation may also improve lipid metabolism,
as it has been associated with more favorable body compositio n
(184) and the ability to aid rapid body mass reduction in weight
classsports( 185).
common genetic variants in choline ( pemt gene ) and a
folate pathway enzyme (mthfd1) have been shown to impact
the metabolic handling of choline and the risk of choline
deficiency across differing nutrient intakes ( 178,186,187). the
relationship between genetic variants in folate metabolis m and
choline requirement may arise from the overlapping roles of
folate and choline in methionine and phosphatidylcholine (pc )biosynthesis. pc is critical for the structural integrity o f cell
membranes and cell survival, and methionine is an essential
amino acid that plays a critical role in human metabolism
and health ( 187,188). themthfd1 rs2236225 snp, which is
associatedwithfolatemetabolism,hasbeenshowntoincrease the
demandsforcholineasamethyl-groupdonor,therebyincreas ing
dietary requirements for this nutrient ( 188). individuals that
are a allele carriers of the mthfd1 gene have been shown
to develop signs of choline deficiency and organ (liver and
muscle) dysfunction compared to those with the gg genotype
(186,188,189).
while humans can make choline endogenously viathe
hepaticphosphatidylethanolamine n-methyltransferase( pemt)

to influence the risk of choline deficiency and the partitionin g
of more dietary choline toward pc biosynthesis at the expense
of betaine synthesis (used a methyl donor) ( 186). individuals
who are c allele carriers of the pemtgene have been shown to
develop signs of choline deficiency and organ (liver and muscle )
dysfunctioncomparedtothosewiththegggenotype( 178).
athletes by nature experience muscle damage through high
volume and high intensity training ( 195). a deficient or
suboptimal status of choline may place additional stressors o n
an athlete’s ability to recover, repair and adapt to their give n
trainingstimulus.
macronutrients and body composition
several aspects of physique such as body size, shape and
composition contribute to the success of an athlete, in most
sports. in the athletic population, body composition is often the
focus for change, as it can be easily manipulated through diet a s
both total energy intake and macronutrient composition ( 192,
196).variationsinmacronutrientintakecansignificantlyimpa ct
both body fat percentage and lean mass ( 29,190,193,197–199),
as well as performance, where macronutrient manipulation has
long been used to partition calories to be used for specific goals
acrossdifferentsports( 196).
although research examining dietary factors and genetics
hasrevealedthatmanipulationofdietaryfatandproteininta kes
may have greater modifying effects on body composition
than carbohydrates, all macronutrients serve a critical
purpose. carbohydrates provide a key fuel for the brain,
cns and working muscles, and the amount and timing
of intake impacts sport performance over a large range of
intensities ( 200,201). adequate dietary protein is essential
for strength and lean body mass accretion, while also playing
a relevant role in preserving lean body mass during caloric
restriction and immune function ( 29,202,203). dietary
fat provides energy for aerobic activities and is required
for the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins ( 204). recent
research shows that percent energy intake from protein
and fat can be targeted to the individual based on genetic
variation for optimizing body weight and composition
(190,193,197–199). percent energy from carbohydrates
should be guided by fuel needs for training and competition
while also considering targeted protein and fat intakes base d on
geneticvariation.

protein
theftogene is also known as the ‘fat mass and obesity-
associated gene’ since it has been shown to impact weight
managementandbodycomposition( 194,199,205,206).dietary
interventions may mitigate genetic predispositions associa ted
with a higher body mass index (bmi) and body fat percentage,
as determined by genetic variation in the ftogene. specifically,
the preventing overweight using novel dietary strategies
(pounds lost) multicenter trial found that carrying an a
allele of the ftogene (rs1558902–a surrogate marker for
rs9939609) and consuming a high protein diet was associated
with a significantly lower fat mass at the 2-year follow
up period compared to carrying two t alleles. importantly,
participants with the aa genotype (lesser effects in those
with at genotype) who were following the high protein diet
protocol had significantly greater losses of total fat mass, t otal
adipose tissue, visceral adipose tissue, lower total percent f at
mass and percent trunk fat, compared to those following a
lower protein diet protocol ( 199). other studies have shown
similar results where dietary protein intake was shown to
be protective against the effect of the ftorisk variants on
bmi and waist circumference ( 194). a randomized controlled
trial (rct) in 195 individuals showed that a hypocaloric diet
resultedingreaterweightlossinrs9939609aallelecarrie rsthan
noncarriers in both higher and lower protein diets, although
metabolicimprovementsimprovedinallgenotypesinthehigher
protein diets ( 205). athletes who possess the aa genotype
of theftogene at rs1558902 would benefit the most in
terms of consuming a moderate-to-high protein diet (at least
25% of energy from protein) to optimize body composition.
greater lean mass in athletes has been associated with improv ed
performance in strength and power sports, as well as some
endurance events, and a decreased risk for injuries ( 191,207).
for those athletes who do not possess the response variant
(i.e., greater fat loss with higher protein intakes), followi ng
a diet with moderate protein intake ( ∼15–20% energy), to
achieve and maintain an ideal body composition is important
to note, as excess protein calories may be counterproductive
toward this goal. in this instance, dietary goals for optimal
performance may be better met by substituting protein energy
for other macronutrients such as carbohydrates for fuel, fib er,
prebiotics and other micronutrients, or by increasing intak es of
essentialfats.
dietary fat
dietary fat, an essential component of the human diet, provide s
energy for aerobic endurance exercise and is necessary for
the absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins a, d, e, and k.
independent of total energy intake, the percentage of energy
derivedfromfatinanathlete’sdietcanimpactbodycompositi on,
based on genetic variation ( 204). individuals possessing the tt
genotype of tcf7l2, transcription factor 7 like 2, at rs7903146
appeartobenefitfromconsumingalowerpercentoftotalenergy
fromfat(20–25%ofenergy)tooptimizebodycomposition( 198).
specifically, participants with the tt genotype lost more fat
mass when they were consuming a low-fat diet, compared to a
high-fat diet (40–45% of energy) ( 198). moreover, individualswith the cc genotype in rs7903146 who consumed lower-fat
diets actually lost significantly more lean mass, suggesting that
these individuals should avoid low-fat nutrition intervent ions
(197) in order to optimize body composition for athletic
performance ( 191,207). body composition can, therefore, be
optimizedbytargetingfatintakebasedongeneticvariation inthe
tcf7l2gene.
monounsaturated fat
recommendations for fat intake can be further targeted to the
different types of fats comprising total dietary fat. athletes wi th

mufascanbetargetedinathleteswhoareaimingtodecrease
their body fat. it is well-known that a lower body fat percenta ge
is associated with enhanced performance in most sports ( 191,
207), however, sport clinicians must be cautious about nutritio n
recommendations aimed at reducing body fat. striving for ve ry
low levels of body fat is highly correlated with the relative
energy deficiency in sport (red-s) syndrome in both females
and males, which refers to ‘impaired physiological functionin g
caused by relative energy deficiency and includes impairment s
of metabolic rate, menstrual function, bone health, immuni ty,
proteinsynthesisandcardiovascularhealth( 209).
saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat
a nested case-control study found that the ratio of dietary
saturatedfattyacids(sfa)topolyunsaturatedfattyacids( pufa)
influenced the risk of obesity associated with the ta and
aa variants of the ftogene at rs9939609 ( 210). specifically,
participantspossessingtheaallelehadasignificantlyhigher bmi
and waist circumference (wc) compared to tt homozygotes,
but only when intakes of sfa were high and pufas were low.
when participants with the a allele consumed <∼15% of
energy from sfa and had a higher dietary pufa:sfa ratio,
there were no significant differences in wc and bmi between
this group and participants with the tt genotype of rs9939609
(210). these findings have implications for nutrition counseling

genetic testing for personalized nutrition may, therefore, be an
additional tool that can be implemented into the practice of
sport clinicians, nutritionists and coaches to guide nutrit ional

athleticperformance.

abstract 
background: among athletes, bodybuilders are more predisposed to the use of dietary supplements (ds) and hor -
mones (h) to increase in adaptations to physical training and performance. the purpose of the study was to identify 
social, psychological, and organisational factors that are associated with the use of food supplements and hormones 
in young bodybuilders of the metropolitan area of naples.
methods: 107 athletes, practicing bodybuilding, were consecutively recruited in 30 gyms, randomly selected in the 
metropolitan area of naples. athletes were administered an anonymous questionnaire. the questionnaire consists 
of 5 sections (socio-demographic, frequency and reasons for bodybuilding, knowledge, attitudes and behaviours). 
descriptive statistics were performed using t-test and chi-square statistics. a score was created for knowledge, atti-
tudes, behaviours. multivariable logistic regression models were employed to assess association between each score 
and the use of ds and h. statistical analyses were carried out using stata 15.
results: 81.31% of the subjects reported to use ds while 35.51% h. females are less likely to practise bodybuilding 
frequently than males (or 0.18 (95% ci 0.05–0.69), p = 0.01). subjects who have attended high school or university 
have a lower probability of taking ds (or 0.17 (95% ci 0.04–0.65), p = 0.01). h users also use supplements more 
frequently (or 61.21 (95% ci 3.99–939.31), p < 0.001). those who scored higher on knowledge scores are more likely 
to take ds (or 1.53 (95% ci 1.11–2.12), p < 0.001). attitudes are correlated with the use of ds; those who scored higher 
were less likely to use ds (or 0.77 (95% ci 0.30–0.98), p = 0.03). people who use ds are 30 times more likely to use 
h at the same time (or 30.25 (95% ci 2.51–365.24), p < 0.001). subjects who have a higher score for knowledge and 
attitudes are less likely to use h (or 0.68 (95% ci 0.54–0.87), p < 0.001, or 0.75 (95% ci 0.62–0.90), p < 0.001).
conclusions: prevalence of h and ds’ use, although lower than reported in the literature, is a worrying public health 
problem. better knowledge can lead to an informed use. gym instructors should be trained to provide accurate and 
scientifically sound information. health professionals should combine their expertise to provide more comprehensive 
guidance to the exercisers.

bodybuilding is a sport in which the athlete is judged on 
muscular appearance. proper preparation for a body -
building contest generally involves years of strength 
training followed by a phase in which the athlete focuses open access

on drastically reducing body fat to improve muscle 
appearance [1, 2].. bodybuilding’s training programs are 
characterized by a separation of training into four dis -
tinct periods: off-season, pre-contest, peak week, and 
post-contest. each period has a specific spectrum of 
intensity load, total training volume, and exercise type 
(multi- or single-joint) . the bodybuilders’ goal is to 
develop muscular hypertrophy and to obtain low fat 
levels based on a balanced body shape . since energy 
restriction prior to competition has a negative effect 
on anabolic hormones, it can result in a reduction in 
serum concentrations of hormones such as testosterone, 
insulin-like growth factor-1 (igf-1) and insulin . so 
among athletes, bodybuilders are more predisposed to 
the use of dietary supplements (ds) and hormones (h) 
as compared to other sportsmen . the aim of the con -
sumption of these substances is the increase in adapta -
tions to physical training and physical performance. in 
addition to friends and family, advertisements through 
media were the main source of information on supple -
ment use; very few obtained information/advice from 
their physicians . the most common ds currently 
used are vitamins, minerals, protein powders/liquid, 
and amino acids . the use of ds is also a risk factor 
for illicit substance use and may cause so-called inadvert -
ent doping due to the contamination of their ingredients 
with, for example, oxilofrine, β-methylphenethylamine 
(bmpea) and n,β-dimethylphenethylamine (nbdm -
pea), the stimulant 4-methylhexan-2-amine (methylhex -
aneamine, 1,3-dimethylamylamine, dmaa), the anabolic 
steroids boldione (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione) and 
5-androstene-3β,17α-diol (17α-aed), the beta-2 agonist 
higenamine and the beta-blocker bisoprolol [7, 8].
however, the exact health benefits ds are still not well 
established [9, 10]. moreover, various possible hazards 
were described when used inappropriately or without 
medical consultation .
in italy, a medical prescription is not required for natu -
ral health products so ds are easily available for self-care 
and self-selection.
the main eu rules concerning food supplements is 
directive 2002/46/ec . since an excessive intake can 
cause undesirable effects [13–17], the directive provides 
for the establishment of maximum amounts of vitamins 
and minerals to be added to food supplements. in italy, 
in addition to the transposition of these directives (leg -
islative decree no. 169 of 21 may 2004 and subsequent 
amendments ), in order to ensure an adequate level 
of quality and safety of dietary supplements, the ministry 
of health published in november 2018 the “recommen -
dations on the good manufacturing practices of food sup -
plements” , aimed at providing technical indications that 
meet the specific needs of the manufacturing industries . at the present time, ds that have as ingredients the 
substances allowed by the legislation can be placed on 
the market. if this condition does not occur, it is neces -
sary to request an ad hoc authorization, based solely on 
the demonstration of safety of use, as governed by eu 
regulation 2015/2283 on novel foods .
at the same time, it should be emphasized that for the 
placing on the market of a substance such as ds and/or 
ingredient of a ds, no proof of efficacy is required.
about 50% of the general population and up to 100% of 
athletes in some sports have reported taking dietary sup -
plement [11, 21]. in a recent study on spanish bodybuild -
ers, 100% of subjects reported consuming ds .
although many mechanisms of action in improving 
performance have been proposed for ds, there are few 
studies that demonstrate real efficacy. for example, very 
high intakes of arginine may increase exercise-induced 
human growth hormone (hgh) release, but this does 
not correspond to an objective increase in sports perfor -
mance; carnitine should improve skeletal muscle func -
tion but there is no evidence that carnitine improves 
physical performance in healthy subjects . also, cre -
atine is a popular supplement for elevating energy during 
short, high-intensity exercises .
several studies have indicated adverse effects of dietary 
supplements consumption, including cardiovascular, 
hematological, metabolic, and neurological problems [14, 
22]. despite the availability of wide information about 
supplement utilization from different parts of the world, 
limited data is available from italy.
sometimes bodybuilders use banned substances such 
as diuretics, stimulants, or anabolic substances, included 
in the list of prohibited methods and substances pub -
lished by the world anti-doping agency (wada) . 
previous reports that have analyzed the prevalence of 
use of anabolic steroids suggest polypharmacy and high 
doses of injectable agents . nandrolone decanoate 
and sustanon, a combination product of 4 testosterone 
esters, were the most commonly reportedly used agents 
. the use of prohibited substances is estimated to be 
1–5% in the general population, reaching up to 50% in 
some sports [26, 27].
the use of doping agents has become a public health 
problem as it also affects young and non-professional 
athletes . however, there are objective health risks 
including cardiovascular illnesses, diabetes, cancer, men -
tal health problems, virilization in women and the sup -
pression of the androgens produced naturally in men 

given that bodybuilders are an high risk category of ds 
and h consumption and that studies carried out in italy 
in this population are lacking, our purpose was to iden -
tify the social, psychological, and organisational factors page 3 of 11
 montuori et al. bmc sports science, medicine and rehabilitation (2021) 13:147 
 
that are associated with the use of food supplements and 
hormones in young bodybuilders of the metropolitan 
area of naples.
methods
study design and setting
a cross-sectional analysis of data from 107 athletes, prac -
ticing bodybuilding, recruited from 30 gyms, randomly 
selected in the metropolitan area of naples, has been 
performed. inclusion criteria for the gyms were to be 
located in naples provinces and have at least one body -
building course held by a bodybuilding instructor with 
a technical card recognized by coni (italian national 
olympic committee). for each gym, all subjects enrolled 
in bodybuilding courses, aged over 18 years and able to 
understand every item of the questionnaire were eligible, 
with no regard to sex, skin color, class, or social group. 
in italy, the fipe (italian weightlifting federation) federal 
council decided to assimilate the contents of resolution 
no.1568 of 14 february 2017 of the national council of 
coni about the authentic interpretation of the definition 
of "activities with overloads and resistances aimed at fit -
ness and physical well-being" specified below: “physical 
culture (bodybuilding) includes all those activities that 
use any form of load (or resistance) to achieve the goal 
in terms of sports (competitive and non-competitive), 
conditioning (fitness) also aimed at competitive perfor -
mance, well-being (wellness) and recovery of physical 
efficiency” . for this reason, both professional and 
non-professional athletes, both competing bodybuilders 
and amateur bodybuilders have been enrolled. no sample 
size calculation was performed because data on the total 
number of athletes practicing bodybuilders in the area 
was not possible to retrieve. however, our study popula -
tion size is comparable to study populations from previ -
ous studies on the topic conducted in similar settings [4, 
30]. informed consent was obtained from each partici -
pant, the project was approved by the ethics committee 
of medical school of the university “federico ii” and all 
methods were carried out in accordance with relevant 
guidelines and regulations.
study population and study variables
athletes were administered an anonymous paper ques -
tionnaire. each participant was instructed on how to 
fill in the questionnaire, providing a list of the most 
frequently used ds and h with the commercial name 
and defining some variables. in particular, it was speci -
fied that for the “reason for bodybuilding” variable, 
the answer "other reasons" included "improve health", 
"lose weight", "increase strength", "participate in com -
petitions"; while for the "bodybuilding frequency" vari -
able, the "seldomly" response included the subjects who practice less than 3 workouts a week and to the "fre -
quently" group all the others. the questionnaire (see 
additional file  1), which was mirrored on existing ques -
tionnaires and adapted [31–33], consists of 58 questions 
focusing on bodybuilding, supplements and hormones. 
the questionnaire consists of 5 sections. the first sect. (6 
questions) asks socio-demographic information while 
the second one (5 questions) asks information about fre -
quency and reasons for bodybuilding. the third sect. (11 
questions), concerning knowledge, and the fourth (16 
questions), concerning attitudes, were assessed on a 
three-point likert scale (agree, uncertain and disagree) 
while the fifth sect.  (20 questions), concerning behav -
iours, is based on a 4-degree scale (yes, often, sometimes, 
never). for each section, using a likert scale, a score 
ranging from 1 to 3 or from 1 to 4 was created. for the 
"knowledge" and "behaviours" sections, the highest score 
was attributed to the correct answer or to the healthier 
behaviour, while for the "attitudes" the higher score was 
attributed to the attitude that could lead to healthier 
behavior. the questionnaire underwent an internal vali -
dation, was pre-tested and modifications were been made 
to improve validity of responses. specifically, the ques -
tionnaire was administered to 20 public health trainees 
based at the department of public health to discuss clar -
ity of the questions.
the following information from the survey was 
included in the following study: age, sex, weight, height, 
education attainment, employment status, reasons for 
bodybuilding, frequency of bodybuilding, duration of 
practice, use of supplements, use of hormones, smoke 
habits, knowledge, attitude and behaviour’s scores. as 
regards education attainment, the italian school system 
is structured in three cycles of education: primary edu -
cation, which includes primary school, lasting five years; 
secondary education, which includes a three-year lower 
secondary school, and a five-year high school.
statistical analysis
descriptive statistics of the study variables were per -
formed using t-test, chi-square and fisher’s exact test 
statistics, as appropriate. for the multivariable analyses, a 
score was created for each section (knowledge, attitudes, 
behaviours). multivariable logistic regression models 
were employed to assess the association between each 
score and the use of supplements and hormones.
four binary outcome variables were selected: body -
building frequency (seldomly, frequently), bodybuilding 
reasons (other reasons, improve body look), use of sup -
plements, use of hormones. models were adjusted for 
age, gender, bmi, education attainment, employment, 
smoking and the remaining outcome variables.
statistical analyses were carried out using stata 15.page 4 of 11 montuori et al. bmc sports science, medicine and rehabilitation (2021) 13:147 
results
of the 107 participants, 68% are male and 32% are 
female. 81.31% of the subjects reported to use sup -
plements while 35.51% hormones. table  1 shows the 
characteristics of the patients divided by use of supple -
ments, hormones, and by gender.
81.31% of the athletes declared to use supplements. 
65.52% of the subjects who use supplements are male 
while only the 34.48% are female. the majority of sub -
jects who use supplements (55.17%) completed the high 
school while the percentages regarding employment 
status are very similar: 32.18% are unemployed, 36.78% 
are employed, 31.03% are self-employed. 63.22% of the 
subjects who use supplements practice bodybuilding 
for aesthetic reasons, 75.86% declare to practice it fre -
quently while 51.72% declare that they have been train -
ing for less than 5 years. for these variables, there is no 
difference between the group that uses supplements 
and the one that does not use them (p > 0.05). the aver -
age age of those who use supplements is lower than 
those who do not use them (31.13 vs 34.45, p = 0.048). 
the 42.53% of subjects who use supplements say they 
also use hormones (p = 0.002).
35.51% of the interviewed subjects declared to use 
hormones. of these, 71.05% are male and only 28.05% 
are female. the average age of hormone users is 32.42 
and there is no difference with that of non-users (31.37, 
p = ns). as for supplements, even in the case of hor -
mones, those who use them have more frequently a 
high school diploma (50.00%), while as regards employ -
ment status, the distribution is very similar in the three 
groups (unemployed: 31.58%; employed: 36.84%; self-
employed: 31.58%, p = ns). most people who use hor -
mones practice bodybuilding to improve body look 
(57.89%), 76.32% train frequently and 47.37% declare to 
practice bodybuilding for more than 5 years.
for the use of hormones, there is no difference in the 
two groups for any variable (p > 0.05).
it is interesting to note that those who use hormones 
also tend to use supplements at the same time (97.37%, 
p = 0.002).
on average, females have a higher level of education 
than males (p = 0.045), while males tend to train more 
frequently (p = 0.029). for the other variables consid -
ered, there is no statistically significant difference.
as shown in table  2, female subjects are less likely 
to practise bodybuilding frequently than male subjects 
(fully adjusted model—or 0.18 (95% ci 0.05–0.69), 
p = 0.01). for the "bodybuilding frequency" outcome 
variable, no other statistically significant association 
was found.for the "bodybuilding reason" outcome variable, no 
variable considered was associated in any of the con -
structed models (table 3).
as shown in table  4, compared to those with a mid -
dle school diploma, subjects who have attended high 
school or university have a lower probability of tak -
ing supplements (fully adjusted model—or 0.17 (95% 
ci 0.04–0.65), p = 0.01). hormone users also use sup -
plements more frequently (fully adjusted model—or 
61.21 (95% ci 3.99–939.31), p < 0.001). in addition, those 
who scored higher on knowledge scores are more likely 
to take supplements (fully adjusted model—or 1.53 
(95% ci 1.11–2.12), p < 0.001). only in the fully adjusted 
model, attitudes are correlated with the use of supple -
ments; those who scored higher were less likely to use 
supplements (fully adjusted model—or 0.77 (95% ci 
0.30–0.98), p = 0.03).
finally, table  5 shows the associations between hor -
mone intake and the other variables taken into consid -
eration. people who use supplements are 30 times more 
likely to use hormones at the same time (fully adjusted 
model—or 30.25 (95% ci 2.51–365.24), p < 0.001). sub -
jects who have a higher score for knowledge and attitudes 
are less likely to use hormones (fully adjusted model—
or 0.68 (95% ci 0.54–0.87), p < 0.001, or 0.75 (95% ci 
0.62–0.90), p < 0.001).
as far as the source of information is concerned, it is 
interesting to note that for ds 83.18% of subjects declare 
to inquire at the gym, 71.03% on the internet and 64.49% 
from their doctor/nutritionist. for h, on the other hand, 
42.45% of subjects declare to obtain information in the 
gym, 25.23% on the internet, 38.22% from their doctor/
nutritionist (data not shown).
discussion
the hypotheses tested in the present research concern 
the possibility that the basic knowledge of bodybuilders 
influences the use of ds and h. if this is true in profes -
sional bodybuilders, it is interesting to know whether in 
a mixed population of professional and non-professional 
bodybuilders, this phenomenon occurs. if this were the 
case, in fact, the phenomenon could be conditioned with 
health education interventions.
in the present study, 81.31% of the subjects reported to 
use supplements while 35.51% hormones. subjects who 
have attended high school or university have a lower 
probability of taking supplements, while hormone users 
also use supplements more frequently. in addition, those 
who scored higher on knowledge scores are more likely 
to take supplements; instead, those who scored higher on 
attitude scores were less likely to use supplements.
finally, people who use supplements are 30 times more 
likely to use hormones at the same time and subjects who page 5 of 11

have a higher score for knowledge and attitudes are less 
likely to use hormones.
gym trainees constitute an important target for dietary 
supplement markets and professional bodybuilders fre -
quently consume banned substances and hormones in 
large dosages [4, 33, 34]. the chosen population, there -
fore, being made up of professional and non-professional 
bodybuilders, should place itself between the two popu -
lations indicated above. nevertheless, the prevalence of 
dietary supplements use we found (81.31%) is higher than 
described in most recent studies in gym users (36.8–
43.8%) [5, 34–36], but it is closer to what is reported by 
morrison et al. (2004) in usa gym trainees (84.7%) . 
it is interesting to note that in international athletes and 
professional bodybuilders the prevalence of the use of 
supplements is 82.2% and 100%, respectively [4, 32]. the 
prevalence of steroid hormones’ use among bodybuilders 
reported in the literature is between 83.3 and 72.9% [4, 
25]. in the present study, only 35.51% of subjects report 
using hormones. this discrepancy would be attributable 
to the belonging of the subjects to the non-professional 
category.
however, the discrepancies in the reported prevalence 
rates of supplements and hormones use may be related to 
sociodemographic and cultural characteristics, the type 
of gyms included or methodologic aspects, namely what 
was considered to be a supplement or hormone and the 
method of data acquisition. however, research indicates 
that direct questioning of sensitive information, such as 
the use of performance enhancing drugs, is character -
ized by underreporting . we found that supplement 
and hormones consumption was more prevalent among men, although not statistically significant. even though 
the role of gender as a determinant of use is not clearly 
established, our result is consistent with previous studies 
[5, 35, 38, 39].
the associated use of supplements and hormones is 
consistent with what is already present in literature, con -
firming the trend towards polypharmacotherapy .
to our knowledge, the scoring method used for ana -
lysing questionnaires has never been used to investigate 
the relationships between use of supplements and hor -
mones and risk factors. moreover, in literature there are 
several articles that associate the frequency or reasons 
of exercise with the use of substances, characterizing 
them as factors of considerable influence in the athlete’s 
decision-making process [36, 40]. therefore, we decided 
to choose 4 outcome variables that characterized the 
entire decision-making process of the athletes to evaluate 
which associations were with modifiable and non-modi -
fiable factors. in particular, from the multinomial logistic 
analysis, it emerges that female subjects tend to prac -
tice bodybuilding less frequently. this attitude is likely 
to reflect specific cultural characteristics. gwizdek et al. 
reported that gender did not have any significant influ -
ence on exercise dependence .
the data of considerable interest that emerged from 
multivariable models is the role of knowledge in the 
choice of the substances used. it seems, in fact, that sub -
jects with higher education attainment, and with a higher 
score in the knowledge section, are able to discriminate 
between supplements and hormones, know the differ -
ences and seem able to choose the substance that harms 
them less to health. alhomoud et  al. suggest that there table 3 association between knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour and bodybuilding reasons (x, y)

are significant differences in the knowledge of health sci -
ences and non-health sciences students pertaining to the 
health benefits and safety of these supplements, what 
they are and the source of information and help which 
should be sought when using them . to the best of 
our knowledge, there are no specific studies conducted 
on the population of amateur bodybuilders.
the present study is one of the few that investigates the 
use of supplements and hormones among amateur body -
builders by integrating the data with that of ad hoc scores 
on knowledge, attitudes and behaviours. this approach 
allows us to understand which factors can be used to 
change behaviours and gain health. the present study, 
however, has some limitations. first of all, a complete list 
of substances considered supplements or hormones has 
not been provided and the result could be strongly influ -
enced by the subject’s personal culture. hence, the ability 
to act without conditioning may have overestimated the 
use of supplements and underestimated the use of hor -
mones. the results obtained, however, compared with lit -
erature, lead us to believe that they are not too far from 
reality. secondly, the main source of information was not 
requested in a specific question. however, 6 questions in 
the behavior section concern the main sources of infor -
mation (gym, internet, doctor/nutritionist) and can offer 
an overview, albeit not exhaustive, of the issue. in retro -
spect, we realized that it could be useful to know where 
the correct information was coming from. in addition, a 
question on whether use was based on medical advice or 
not was not included in the tool and it is difficult to gen -
eralize the results because the study was carried out in 
province of naples only. finally, we suspect the variable 
scoring system likely did not capture all differences to be 
identified, although, to better identify the role of the sin -
gle scores and their association with the other outcome 
variables, it was decided to use partially adjusted models 
and a fully adjusted model.
conclusions
the high prevalence of dietary supplement use among 
naples bodybuilders reflects a public health concern as, 
although there are supplements that appear to be effec -
tive, indiscriminate use can be correlated with serious 
health risks. the prevalence of hormone use, although 
lower than reported in the literature, is similarly a wor -
rying public health problem. the two problems appear 
related as evidenced by frequent combined use. better 
knowledge can lead to an informed use of these sub -
stances. it is desirable that gym instructors and coaches, 
who are the people who are most likely to interface with 
such athletes, should be sufficiently trained to be able to 
provide accurate and scientifically sound information on 
dietary supplements and hormones to the gym users.health professionals, including physicians, dietitians, 
and pharmacists, should combine their expertise with 
that of coaches and athletic trainers in order to provide 
more comprehensive guidance to the exercisers. specific 
and multidisciplinary health education programs could 
be created involving prevention departments and local 
health authorities.

abstract
summary a growing body of evidence suggests that diet quality may predict muscle health. this study found that a “traditional ”
dietary pattern predicted greater muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet pr edicted greater muscle mass and better
muscle function over 15 years. these findings reinforce the importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing.
introduction research investigating the roles of individual nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic rela-
tionships between foods and nutrients. this study aimed to investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary patterns for
muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period.
methods this longitudinal study was conducted in 522 men from the geelong osteoporosis study with complete dietary and
muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and 15-year follow-up assessments. dietary exposures were extracted from
food frequency questionnaires and included the australian recommended food score, the dietary inflammatory index (dii®),
and three a posteriori dietary patterns: plant-focused, western, and traditional (anglo-australian). outcome variables included
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry –derived skeletal muscle index (smi) and muscle function measured with the timed up-and-go
(tug) test.
results an anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a traditional dietary pattern both predicted greater smi ((b: −0.04
(95%ci −0.08, −0.00) kg/m2) and (b: 0.12 (95%ci 0.04, 0.20) kg/m2), respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted
slower tug (b: 0.11 (95%ci 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year follow-up period. these associations remained significant
following adjustment for confounding variables. there were no associations observed for other dietary exposures.
conclusion a traditional dietary pattern higher in vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and animal protein was associated with greater
skeletal muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet, also rich in vegetables, fruit, and wholegrain cereals, was associated with
greater skeletal muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years.

with advancements in modern medicine and public health,
our global population is steadily ageing. in 2018, for the first
time in history, the population aged over 65 years
outnumbered those aged under 5 years [ 1]. despite improve-
ments in longevity, poor muscle health is associated with re-
duced quality of life and predicts mortality in ageing popula-
tions [ 2,3]. low muscle mass and poor muscle strength and
function are key characteristics of poor muscle health. low
muscle mass predicts reduced mobility, and mobility —in
turn—predicts mortality [ 4,5]. while exercise training is a
key health behaviour that can improve muscle health [ 6], iden-
tifying additional modifiable contributors to muscle health is
imperative to guide intervention strategies.
diet is a known correlate of muscle health [ 7]. research
investigating aspects of nutrition that relate to the risk for poormuscle health have historically focused on individual compo-nents of diet, such as protein and specific micronutrients.
however, a focus on individual macro and micronutrients fails
to consider synergistic relationships between foods and nutri-ents [ 8]. a priori diet quality scores, by contrast, provide a
metric for assessing whole diet quality. these predefined in-dices are usually based on current nutrition guidelines or rec-
ommendations and can be used to quantify an individual ’s
overall diet quality. examples include validated indices mea-
suring adherence to a traditional mediterranean diet (md),
such as the mediterranean diet score (mds), or to local
guidelines, such as the australian recommended foodscore (arfs) [ 9]. another category of a priori diet quality
scores focuses on the functional effect of the foods and nutri-ents—e.g. on ability to effect changes in blood glucose (e.g.
the glycaemic index [ 10]) or inflammation (e.g. the dietary
inflammatory index [dii®])[ 11]. in contrast, data-driven a
posteriori dietary patterns reflect the eating patterns specificto the study sample. these can be developed using principal
component analysis, which cluster a study sample ’sd i e t a r y
patterns into distinct factors based on individuals ’frequency
of consumption of specific foods.
previously, studies investigating how diet quality scores
relate to muscle mass and function in men longitudinally over
2 to 10 years have reported conflicting findings. the baltic
sea diet score, considered the diet quality measure similar to
the mds for nordic populations, did not predict either musclemass or walking speed in finnish men over 10 years [ 12,13].
similarly, in a sample of chinese adults >65 years of age,neither the mds nor data-driven dietary patterns providedany predictive value for sarcopenia risk over 4 years [ 14].
however, in an italian cohort, higher scores on the mds atbaseline were associated with a lower risk of developing re-duced walking speed over 6 years [ 15]. these conflicting
findings may be due to the varying timespans and/or agegroups studied, or to the application of indices measuringthe md in non-mediterranean cultures. due to the chronic
inflammation associated with increases in age and decreases
in physical functioning, the dietary inflammatory index(dii®), a measure of the inflammatory potential of partici-
pants ’diets, has also has been utilised in muscle health re-
search [ 16]. the relationship between the dii and muscle
health has been investigated in chinese children andaustralian adults, with results from the latter suggesting an
association between the dii and muscle health in australianwomen, but not men, over 10 years of follow-up [ 17,18].
studies investigating the relationship between a posteriori
dietary patterns and men ’s
 muscle mass and function are
scarcer. however, from the limited evidence, a western die-
tary pattern was associated with poorer muscle function and a
md-style pattern associated with better muscle function inspanish men aged 55 –80 years in one cross-sectional study
. furthermore, an investigation of culturally specific die-
tary patterns in uk men aged ≥85 years found that a diet high
in meat, potato, and gravy predicted a slower timed up-and-go
(tug), which assesses muscle function via walking speed,
balance, and mobility, than those who consumed less meat,over 5 years [ 20].
findings from available studies addressing the role of diet
in the maintenance of muscle mass and function are discordant
in relation to age, muscle outcome measures, follow-up times,
and ethnic groups. the diverse findings may reflect the needfor measures of diet quality that are culturally specific to study
samples or, at the other extreme, the need to describe diet
quality in terms of physiological effects independent of culi-nary traditions and cultural foodways. the current study
aimed to investigate the predictive value of various measures
of diet quality and dietary patterns for muscle mass and func-tion in australian men over a 15-year period.
methods
participants
study participants included 522 men from the baseline and
15-year follow-up of the geelong osteoporosis study
(gos). the gos, an ongoing prospective cohort study, hasbeen collecting data on men since 2001. participants were
randomly selected from the electoral roll of the barwon
statistical division and invited to participate. details of re-
cruitment, data collection, and participation have been pub-
lished elsewhere [ 21]. the gos was approved by the human
research ethics committee at barwon health, and written,
informed consent is collected from all participants.
participants included in the current study were those who
had provided complete food frequency dietary data at bothtimepoints, in addition to complete dual-energy x-ray absorp-
tiometry (dxa) scans and/or tug data at both timepoints.2194 osteoporos int (2021) 32:2193–2203participants were excluded if energy intake was considered
implausible, i.e. excessively high or low, defined as <3360
or >16,800 kj/day [ 22]( f i g . 1).
data collection
anthropometry and body composition
height was measured with a wall-mounted stadiometer and
accurate to the nearest 0.1cm. body composition was deter-
mined from whole body dxa using a densitometer (lunar
dpx-l and lunar prodigy-pro, lunar corporation,madison, wi, usa). in the baseline cohort, the dpx-l was
used on the initial n=544 and the prodigypro was used with
the remaining n=996. however, no mean differences in bonemineral density were noted between the two measures [ 21].
from dxa scans, appendicular lean body mass (alm) wascalculated as the sum of lean mass for arms and legs.
muscle mass and function
skeletal muscle index (smi), defined as alm/height
2(kg/
m2), was used as a surrogate measure of muscle mass.
muscle function was measured by the timed up and go
(tug) test, which refers to the time taken (seconds) for aparticipant to rise from a chair, walk 3 m, turn around, walk
back, and sit down, all without upper body assistance unless
using a walking aid such as a walking frame [ 23]. slower
tug is an indicator of poor muscle function. the cut-offs
for low smi and slow tug in the current study were <7.0
kg/m2and≥20 s, respectively, as per recommendations from
the revised european working group on sarcopenia in older
people (ewgsop2) [ 24].
dietary data
self-reported dietary data were collected using a food frequen-
cy questionnaire (ffq), the cancer council victoria ’s
dietary questionnaire for epidemiological studies, which
has been validated in a similar population [ 9]. in brief, data
relating to frequency of consumption of specific foods at des-
ignated serve sizes were collected for 74 foods, including
milk, in addition to six alcoholic beverages, over the previous
12 months. the cancer council victoria provided computedffq results which included both serves per day and grams per
day.
diet quality indices ffq data were used to calculate the arfs
and the dii scores. the arfs is a validated diet quality index
that measures an individual against adherence to the
fig. 1 prisma diagram for gos
participant selection. participants
included were those who
provided both muscle and diet
data at 10- and 15-year men ’s
follow-ups of the geelong
osteoporosis study2195 osteoporos int (2021) 32:2193–2203australian dietary guidelines. points are allocated based on
serves of and/or frequency of consumption for the following:
(i) vegetables, nuts, and beans, (ii) fruit, (iii) protein foods, (iv)grains, (v) dairy, (vi) fats, and (vii) alcohol, and points are
totalled to obtain a score range of 0 –74 .
the dii score measures dietary inflammatory potential and
has been validated against various biomarkers in over 30 stud-ies . the theoretical dii score range is −8.87 to +7.98,
with a positive score reflecting a pro-inflammatory diet and
a negative score reflecting an anti-inflammatory diet. while
the complete dii includes 45 food parameters associated with
changes in inflammatory markers [ 11], as with most struc-
tured instruments, data from the ffq were available for fewer
(i.e. 22) food parameters.
a posteriori dietary patterns using a principal component
analysis with orthogonal varimax rotation, three dietary pat-
terns were identified from baseline ffq data. food compo-nents with a loading of <0.05 were excluded [ 26], resulting in
a final list of 93 food components from the original 101 listedin the raw ffq data. factor loadings from principle compo-nent analysis were multiplied by participant food consumption
data in grams per day to provide participant scores for each of
the three dietary patterns.
other potential confounders
additional variables for cons ideration as potential con-
founders were collected at both baseline and 15-year fol-
low-up assessment phases. these included age, currentsmoking, highest level of education ((i) never attended
school, (ii) completed primary or some secondary school
(including “primary school ”and “secondary school ”), (iii)
completed secondary school or vocational training (includ-
ing “completed secondary school ”and “tafe/trade/ap-
prenticeship ”), or (iv) tertiary education (including “univer-
sity”and “other post-secondary training/qualification ”));
employment status (either (i) working (including working
full-time, part-time, voluntar y work, and casually), (ii) not
working (including retired and not retired), (iii) home
duties, (iv) full-time or part-time student, (v) retired, (vi)unable to work/ill), or (vii) not applicable); ethnicity; totalprotein intake (g/day); total energy intake (kj/day); and
dxa-derived total body fat mass (g). self-reported physical
activity (pa) was measured using the baecke physical
activity questionnaire [ 27], which uses a likert scale to
assess work, sport, and leisure time pa. scores from these
three domains were combined for a total pa score. a com-
posite, dichotomised variable was developed of self-
reported medications that may impact muscle. these in-cluded agents that affect the musculoskeletal system and
endocrine and metabolic diso rders. medical conditions po-
tentially affecting muscle al so were dichotomised (yes/no)and included osteoarthritis, rh eumatoid arthritis, thyroid
conditions, type-1 and type-2 diabetes mellitus,
hypoglycaemia, pernicious anaemia, asthma, emphysema,chronic bronchitis, and multiple sclerosis.
statistical analyses
to account for the longitudinal nature of this study, general-ised estimating equations (gee) were employed. to assist incomparing beta coefficients between models, all diet quality
scores were converted to z-scores. potential confounders were
first identified using trivariable models, through examiningthe p-values and inclusion if the potential confounder variable
notably altered the b-coefficient of the exposure of interest.
the final multivariable models were determined using a back-wards stepwise variable selection strategy. in addition to the
abovementioned data-driven confounder identification, pa,
and age also were included in all adjusted models due to theirwidely accepted effects on muscle health [ 28]. deviation from
model assumptions, including normality of continuous depen-dent variables, was visually inspected and correlation coeffi-cients were used to assess collinearity. in the final models,
gees were employed to investigate associations between
the dietary exposures and both smi and tug, after account-ing for potential confounders. all variables considered as po-
tential confounders were time-updated. gee models included
a nominal factor for measurement time (baseline, and 15-yearfollow-up), with time-updated diet measurement as the expo-
sure of interest. time-by-diet, age-by-diet, and pa-by-diet
two-way interactions also were investigated. the time-by-diet interaction term examined the effect of diet change (from
baseline to 15-year follow-up) on smi and tug. all analyses
were conducted using stata 16.0 (statacorp lp. college
station, tx, usa) and the analysis plan was preregistered at
open science framework ( https://osf.io/wxzpv ).
results
study participant characteristics at baseline and 15-year fol-
low-up are summarised in table 1and 
and the number of participants who had retired increased,
while median pa scores decreased over the 15-year period.
a greater number of participants were taking medications and
had a current medical condition at 15 years compared to
baseline.
smi reduced over 15 years while the tug scores increased
(i.e. slower times) (fig. 2a and b ). the proportion of partic-
ipants with low smi and slow tug also increased (table 1).
the arfs dietary scores at 15 years correlated with the base-
line time point (r2=0.41, p<0.0001) (fig. 2c) and did not
change over time (table 1). the dii score was also moderate-
ly correlated between the two time points (r2=0.24, p<0.0001)2196 osteoporos int (2021) 32:2193–2203(fig. 2d) and a paired wilcoxon rank sum test indicated that
the scores increased slightly over 15 years (p<0.0001), indi-
cating the diets became marginally more pro-inflammatory
(table 1). dietary energy intake decreased over the 15 years
and bmi and body fat increased between follow-up assess-
ments (table 1).
participants who were lost to follow-up were older than
study sample participants at baseline, with a median age of67 years. these participants had a similar median smi to the
current study sample, but a greater percentage had a low smi
(6.76%). median tug at baseline was also slower (7.91 s)with a greater proportion having a slow tug of ≥20 s (8.0%)
compared to the study sample.diet quality indices and a posteriori dietary patterns
dii scores ranged from −2.99 to +2.53 and, prior to z-score
conversion, arfs scores ranged from 6 to 57.
in addition, three a posteriori dietary patterns at baseline were
identified using principle component analysis (online resource 1).
these were designated (i) plant-focused, which reflected higher
consumption of vegetables, fruit, yoghurt, muesli, multigrainbread, and tofu, and lower consumption of sugar and discretionary
foods, full-fat dairy products, wh ite bread and margarine, red,
white, and processed meats, and alcohol; (ii) western, reflecting
higher consumption of foods such as pizza, meat pies, hamburgers,
and alcohol, with negative factor loadings suggesting lowertable 1 participants

dietary factors and skeletal muscle index
there was no relationship between arfs and smi. however, in
both unadjusted and adjusted models, the dii was inversely as-
sociated with smi, suggesting that consumption of a less inflam-
matory diet was associated with a smaller decrease in smi over15 years (table 2). higher scores on the traditional dietary pat-
tern also predicted smaller reductions smi over 15 years, bothbefore and after adjustment for confounders. there was some
evidence that higher scores on a western dietary pattern were
associated with smaller reduc tions in smi in unadjusted models
(table 2); however, this associatio n was lost following adjust-
ment for age, physical activity, and fat mass, with age being thevariable responsible for attenuation. in the unadjusted model,there was weak evidence that a plant-focused diet was inversely
associated with smi but, like the western dietary pattern, this
association was attenuated after adjustments (table 3).dietary factors and timed up-and-go
the dii was positively associated with the tug measure
(table 3), suggesting that a pro-inflammatory diet was asso-
ciated with slower tug time. while the beta-coefficient was
reduced after adjustment, the model retained significance, in-
dicating that the association between a pro-inflammatory diet
and slower tug persisted after accounting for differences inage and pa. higher scores on the western dietary pattern also
predicted slower tug time. however, the association disap-
peared after adjustment for pa, age, and education.concordant with the smi results, age was the variable that
explained the association. neither the arfs diet quality
score, plant-focused, or traditional dietary patterns were as-sociated with tug time.
discussion
the current study investigated the relationships between apriori dietary indices, the arfs and dii, and a posteriori
dietary patterns derived from raw data, with changes in both
lean muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period.

“traditional ”dietary pattern, characterised by a greater con-
sumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, unprocessed-fish,
wholegrain cereals, and both red and white meats, were asso-
ciated with greater smi, even after adjustment for age andmeasures of physical activity. similarly, an anti-
inflammatory diet was associated with faster tug, even when
adjusted for age and physical activity. however, neither adietary pattern that was also higher in plant foods but lower
in animal proteins, nor a western-style dietary pattern, was
associated with measures of muscle health. moreover, a dietquality score that measures adherence to australian dietary
guidelines, the arfs, was not observed to predict muscle
mass or function over time.
our finding that the dii was a significant independent pre-
dictor of smi and tug is discordant with results from a sim-ilar australian cohort assessed over 10 years, wherein re-searchers reported that an association between the dii and
muscle mass and quality was a ttenuated when controlled
for—among other variables —steps-per-day, age, and body
fat . while cervo et al. also used dxa-derived fat mass
to measure body fat, our current study used the baecke
physical activity questionnaire to measure pa which is,arguably, a more comprehensive measure than the steps-per-day measure of pa used by cervo et al., and may therefore
provide a more accurate reflection of the impact of pa on the
dii-muscle relationship. while there are no prior studies in-vestigating the arfs diet quality score and muscle health, the
arfs has been previously utilised in body weight research in
australians, finding no associations with weight gain over 6years [ 29]. this may be due to some limitations of this dietary
measure. although the arfs is based on types of foods con-sumed per day, it does not take portion sizes into account anddoes not penalise for excessive consumption of discretionary
foods. furthermore, the arfs is based on the 2003 australian
dietary guidelines, which would have been current at base-line in this study but outdated for the 15-year follow-up. for
example, points are awarded for consumption of margarine
but not olive oil, the health benefits of which have been wellestablished since 2003 [ 9,30].
a traditional dietary pattern was associated with smi, but
not tug, even after adjustment for pa, age, and fat mass. thestandardised beta coefficient for the traditional dietary pattern

their diet from the lowest to the highest score of the
traditional dietary pattern would increase their lean mass by1.5kg which may provide a clinically relevant increase in lean
mass [ 24].
in a previous study assessing the relationship between die-
tary patterns and tug in participants aged ≥85 years, re-
searchers reported that a dietary pattern high in fruits, vegeta-
bles, grains, and animal products, and low in processed foods,was associated with faster tug time compared to a dietary
pattern comparable to the current study ’s western dietary pat-
tern [ 20] .s i m i l a rf i n d i n g sh a v eb e e nr e p o r t e dl o n g i t u d i n a l l y
over a 28-year period, showing a diet similar to ourtraditional dietary pattern predicted healthier physical func-
tioning at 60 –64 years old [ 31]. however, in a 9-year longi-
tudinal french study, which utilised subjective physical func-
tioning measures, no such association was observed [ 32].
while a trend was observed between the traditional dietary
pattern and faster tug in the current study, this was attenu-
ated with adjustment for pa, age, and education. the discrep-
ancy between results for the traditional dietary pattern andsmi and tug outcomes may be due to age-related loss of
muscle mass preceding deterioration of functional ability [ 33].
furthermore, this variability in results may also reflect indi-vidual differences in nutrient status [ 34]. for example, a
traditional dietary pattern consumed by a participant who is
protein deficient due to anabolic resistance may have a differ-
ent effect on muscle health than on an individual who is pro-
tein replete. collection of detailed baseline biological data, inaddition to nutrition intake data, to establish participants ’
baseline nutritional status may help to elucidate this potentiald e t e r m i n a n ti nf u t u r er e s e a r c h .
of the three dietary patterns identified in this study, the
traditional dietary pattern was characterised by greater con-sumption of wholegrains and nuts, and a wider variety of plantfoods and animal foods including non-processed fish, com-
pared to the western and plant-focused dietary patterns. the
association observed between the traditional dietary patternand smi may therefore reflect the important role of intake of a
high diversity of foods, which is more likely to provide a
range of micronutrients and other dietary components. whileliterature assessing the association of dietary diversity with
muscle health is scarce, a recent korean study investigated
dietary diversity and sarcopenia, reporting that, cross-section-ally, poor dietary diversity was associated with sarcopenia in
women, but not men. future muscle health research may ben-
efit from investigation of the longitudinal dietary diversity-muscle health relationship. in addition to diversity, the
traditional dietary pattern also included greater consumption
of nuts and non-processed fish, compared to the plant-focusedand western patterns. therefore, fat type in the traditional
dietary pattern may include greater quantities of mono- and
poly-unsaturated fats from these sources. although notcaptured by the ffq, if fresh fish includes oily fish such as
salmon, the traditional dietary pattern may provide greater
levels of omega-3 fatty acids which have been directly asso-ciated with improved muscle metabolism in older adults when
taking in supplemental form [ 35]. the quantity of high-quality
protein provided by animal products in the traditional pattern
may also contribute to muscle metabolism by providing a rich
amino acid pool to fuel muscle protein synthesis. in addition
to quantity and source of protein, timing of its consumption isalso an important consideration for muscle anabolism which
may be a useful ffq component for future diet-muscle
research.
finally, while higher scores on the western dietary pattern
were associated with higher smi and faster tug in unadjust-ed analyses, suggesting a non-intuitive beneficial impact of ahighly processed dietary pattern on muscle health, these asso-
ciations were driven by age, as western dietary pattern scores
were higher in younger males (data not shown).
the biological mechanisms through which healthier die-
tary habits may impact muscle health are numerous and com-plex; however, one such mechanism is the potential role ofnutrition in attenuating systemic inflammation. higher con-
sumption of certain foods such as vegetables, nuts, olive oil,
and foods high in anti-oxidants have been associated with
favourable changes in inflammatory biomarkers [ 36–38]. in
contrast, pro-inflammatory diets which are often low in
wholefoods and micronutrients, and high in fats and refined
carbohydrates, have been associated with increased levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines including il-6, crp, and tnf- α
[11,39]. dysregulation of these cytokines has been implicated
in muscle health research, with higher il-6 and crp levelsassociated with a greater loss of muscle mass longitudinallyover 5 years, and muscle power and strength cross-sectionally
[40,41]. in addition, chronically elevated pro-inflammatory
cy
tokines contribute to oxidative stress which is a hallmark of
age-related inflammation [ 42]. although the precise mecha-
nisms by which dysregulated cytokines affect muscle health
are still unclear, cytokines such il-6 and tnf –αare involved
in regulating signalling pathways for muscle metabolism [ 43].
a potential mechanism of action may therefore be a pro-inflammatory diet increasing oxidative stress which interruptshealthy muscle metabolism signalling.
in addition, a growing body of research supports a “gut-
muscle axis” , one aspect of which is the role of the gut
microbiome in regulating inflammation both locally in the
gut and systemically [ 44]. indeed, high dii diet quality and
traditional dietary pattern scores would also represent dietary
intakes that are higher in fibre and healthy fats, known to lead
to greater abundances of beneficial bacteria in the human gut
[45,46]. furthermore, while greater intakes of fibre and un-
saturated fats have been associated with higher concentrations
of anti-inflammatory metabolites such as butyrate [ 47], greater
consumption of saturated fat has been implicated in increased2200 osteoporos int (2021) 32:2193–2203gut permeability, which is theorised to contribute to systemic
inflammation [ 47]. therefore, both an anti-inflammatory diet
and a traditional diet may be beneficial for muscle health
through maintaining favourable gut microbiome composition
and function.
strengths and limitations
one important strength of this study is the number of partic-ipants with data at two time points, 15 years apart. also, due to
the extensive data collection conducted in gos, we were ableto account for a number of medical and lifestyle variables.
one such variable was the robust baecke physical activity
questionnaire measure of pa, which accounts for leisure,work, and sport pa. this allowed for adequate adjustment
of participants ’pa, which explained several observed associ-
ations. assessment of diet using validated instruments facili-
tated rigorous multidimensional measures of diet quality and
patterns, and dxa-derived lean mass and tug provided ob-
jective measures of muscle health.
despite its strengths, the study has several weaknesses. the
gos recruitment was based on a random sampling technique,which was representative of the european-australian popula-tion and may not be generalisable to other populations includ-
ing men of other ethnicities, nor women. results from the
current study also may reflect those of a healthier cohort ofeuropean-australian partici pants, due to volunteer bias,
which is broadly problematic in human research. moreover,differential loss to follow-up in association with poor musclehealth may have biased our results. due to the limited 22
nutritional dii components available from the ffq data, the
dii scores in the current study may not have been as robust
had we had access to all 45 components in the complete dii
formula. indeed, the range of dii values was narrower thanthose reported previously [ 25]. furthermore, longitudinal diet
data was based on baseline and 15-year time points, fromwhich the gee models calculated a mean value for analyses.more frequent diet data points may have provided a more
accurate measure of diet changes over the 15-years; however,
these values appear to be relatively stable of this time period.
conclusions
ah e a l t h y “traditional ”dietary pattern predicted greater mus-
cle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet predicted greater mus-cle mass and better muscle function over 15 years in
australian men. these findings reinforce the importance of
optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing. future lon-gitudinal research including women and assessing additional
muscle strength outcomes may generate insights directly ap-
plicable to clinical recommendations for preventing and/ortreating sarcopenia. although methodologically challenging,
long-term dietary interventions would also yield insights into
the potential and relative importance of dietary improvementfor optimising muscle health in older adults.

abstract: adequate consumption of dietary protein is critical for the maintenance of optimal health
during normal growth and aging. the current recommended dietary allowance (rda) for protein is
defined as the minimum amount required to prevent lean body mass loss, but is often misrepresented
and misinterpreted as a recommended optimal intake. over the past two decades, the potential
muscle-related benefits achieved by consuming higher-protein diets have become increasingly clear.
despite greater awareness of how higher-protein diets might be advantageous for muscle mass,
actual dietary patterns, particularly as they pertain to protein, have remained relatively unchanged
in american adults. this lack of change may, in part, result from confusion over the purported
detrimental e ects of higher-protein diets. this manuscript will highlight common perceptions and
benefits of dietary protein on muscle mass, address misperceptions related to higher-protein diets,
and comment on the translation of academic advances to real-life application and health benefit.
given the vast research evidence supporting the positive e ects of dietary protein intake on optimal
health, we encourage critical evaluation of current protein intake recommendations and responsible
representation and application of the rda as a minimum protein requirement rather than one
determined to optimally meet the needs of the population.

1. introduction
consuming adequate dietary protein is critical for maintaining optimal health, growth,
development, and function throughout life. dietary protein requirements in healthy adults ( 19 years
old) are dictated largely by body mass and lean body mass, as well as net energy balance and physical
activity [ 1]. the institute of medicine (iom) established the current dietary reference intakes (dris)
for protein in 2005, including the estimated average requirement (ear), recommended dietary
allowance (rda), and the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (amdr) [ 2]. the ear for
protein is 0.66 g per kg body mass per day (g /kg/d) and is defined as the minimum amount of protein
expected to meet the individual indispensable amino acid requirements of 50% of the u.s. adult
population. the rda, however, is 0.8 g /kg/d, and reflects the minimum amount of dietary protein
required to meet indispensable amino acid requirements, establish nitrogen balance, and prevent muscle
mass loss for nearly the entire (i.e., 97.5%) u.s. adult population [ 2,3]. the rda for american adults is
similar to international adult protein recommendations established by the world health organization
(0.83 g /kg/d) . the current protein rda, however, is often incorrectly applied when used as the
definition of recommended intake, rather than its true designation as the required minimum intake.
this misapplication is problematic for healthy populations and aging adults, and disadvantageous for
those with pathophysiological conditions that would necessitate higher-protein needs.
nutrients 2019 ,11, 1136; doi:10.3390 /nu11051136 www.mdpi.com /journal /nutrientsnutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 2 of 13
over the past decade, the potential muscle-related benefits achieved by consuming higher-protein
diets (i.e., >rda but within the amdr) have become increasingly clear. increased protein intake
contributes to greater strength and muscle mass gains when coupled with resistance exercise [ 5],
allows for greater muscle mass preservation when consumed during periods of negative energy
balance [ 6], limits age-related muscle loss [ 7], and, to a lesser extent, provides a greater muscle
protein synthetic response when evenly distributed across meals [ 5,8]. a prospective, cross-sectional
analysis of the national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes) database demonstrates
inverse associations between animal and plant protein intake and waist circumference, body weight,
and body mass index (bmi) [ 9]. advances in this field of nutritional science have translated to a greater
emphasis on higher-protein diets, protein quality, and supplemental protein in peer-reviewed literature,
lay media, and the commercial food market. despite greater awareness of how higher-protein diets
might be advantageous for muscle mass, actual dietary patterns, particularly as they pertain to protein,
have remained relatively unchanged in american adults as a whole [ 10]. the disparity between
knowledge and action raises the question of whether this expanded understanding of dietary protein is
truly meaningful if scientific data are not translated and ultimately reflected in nutrition guidance and,
more importantly, in what people eat. as such, the purpose of this brief communication is to highlight
common perceptions and benefits of dietary protein on muscle mass, to address misperceptions related
to higher-protein diets, and to comment on the translation of academic advances to real-life application
and health benefit.
2. dietary protein and muscle mass perceptions
skeletal muscle protein is dynamic and in constant flux, alternating between states of negative
(i.e., muscle protein synthesis <muscle protein breakdown) and positive (i.e., muscle protein synthesis
>muscle protein breakdown) protein balance, largely in response to fasting (i.e., postabsorptive) and
feeding (i.e., postprandial), respectively. in the postabsorptive state, muscle protein serves as the
primary repository of amino acids that is readily catabolized to release free amino acids that can be
reincorporated into muscle protein or used to support other critical physiological needs, including
serving as an energy substrate through carbon skeleton oxidation, as well as by providing gluconeogenic
precursors to support euglycemia (figure 1). in addition, free amino acids derived from muscle
protein breakdown are used in the synthesis of immune system components, plasma proteins, peptide
hormones, and intra- and extracellular enzymes. transient periods of negative protein balance in healthy
adults are completely normal and reversed by feeding. the magnitude of the postprandial stimulation
of muscle protein synthesis, suppression of muscle (and whole-body) protein breakdown, and shift to
a positive protein balance is mediated by dietary protein content, protein quality (i.e., based on an
individual protein’s digestibility and absorption kinetics, and abundance of indispensable amino acids),
and the format in which protein is consumed (e.g., mixed-macronutrient meal, isolated supplemental
intact protein, or free-form amino acids) [ 6]. the collective optimization of these protein intake-related
factors can potentiate the beneficial e ects of other protein kinetic stimuli, such as the mechanical and
metabolic e ects of resistance and aerobic exercise, respectively, resulting in the enhanced remodeling
and repair of existing muscle proteins and synthesis of new muscle protein, providing the conditions
for muscle maintenance and growth .nutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 3 of 13

2.1. current dietary protein recommendations
the current dris for protein have been in place since 2005 but are not without limitations. the ear
and rda were derived from meta-analyses of nitrogen balance studies [ 12]. the nitrogen balance
method has many limitations and tends to overestimate nitrogen intake (via diet) and underestimate
nitrogen excretion (via urine, feces, sweat, and integumental loss), thus falsely illustrating nitrogen
balance [ 13]. nitrogen balance is also considered a crude measure that fails to provide any informationnutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 4 of 13
as to what occurs within the system to modulate the body nitrogen pool and subsequent balance [ 14,15].
likewise, the amdr for protein (10–35% of total daily energy intake) was established by setting the
lower end of the amdr at the relative amount of protein believed to meet the set rda of 0.8 g /kg/d,
while the upper end is the mathematical di erence achieved if carbohydrate (45–65% of energy) and
fat (20–35% of energy) are consumed at the lower ends of their respective amdr (i.e., 100%  45%
 20%=35% as the upper end of protein amdr) [ 2]. carbohydrate and fat are important energy
substrates and energy balance is critical to optimal health, but this derivation raises uncertainty about
the physiological relevance underlying a recommended upper limit for protein consumption at 35% of
total energy intake.
similarly, the rda may be su cient to meet the dietary protein needs of healthy, relatively
sedentary young adults, though investigators have argued that this recommendation should be
reconsidered based on data from studies demonstrating the inadequacy of the rda within certain
populations when compared to greater requirements derived from the indicator amino acid oxidation
method [ 16]. accordingly, internationally recognized professional organizations recommend protein
intakes on the order of double the current rda for physically active individuals, including the
joint recommendation to consume protein between 1.2–2.0 g /kg/d established by the academy of
nutrition and dietetics, dietitians of canada, and the american college of sports medicine [ 17].
the international society for sports nutrition also recommends protein intake at levels higher than
the rda for physically active individuals (1.4–2.0 g /kg/d) . the definition of the protein rda itself
draws criticism given that it reflects the minimal amount of protein required to prevent deficiency,
rather than an amount which may allow for optimal health. the amdr does provide for more
flexibility in dietary protein intake recommendations in the context of the complete diet, yet most
american adults habitually consume protein on the lower end of this range (i.e., 14–16% of total energy
intake) .
2.2. dietary protein and physical activity
the benefits of consuming protein following resistance exercise training have been
well-documented, especially as they relate to muscle hypertrophy and function [ 18]. a recent
meta-analysis showed significant positive associations between coupling resistance exercise with
post-exercise protein ingestion and total fat-free mass, strength, as measured by one-repetition
maximum, and muscle size, as measured by myofiber cross-sectional area [ 18]. the type and
volume of exercise plays a determining role in muscle protein synthetic responses to post-exercise
protein ingestion [ 19,20], as does age [ 21] and the training experience [ 18] of the individual.
the type of protein consumed also factors into the net anabolic response, given that postprandial
muscle protein and whole-body protein kinetic responses to free-form amino acids, isolated
intact proteins, and mixed-macronutrient meals all di er [22–24]. as reflected in sports nutrition
recommendations [ 1,17], holistic evaluation of varied experimental designs suggests that coupling
post-resistance exercise protein ingestion (~20–30 g or 0.25–0.30 g /kg) with habitual protein intakes at
~1.6 g /kg/d promotes favorable muscle adaptations to exercise training .
2.3. dietary protein during energy deficit
consuming higher amounts of protein during typical moderate energy-deficient weight loss
diets (i.e., 500–750 kcal /d deficit [ 25]) preserves muscle mass in an otherwise catabolic physiological
environment [ 6]. however, the protective e ect of higher-protein diets on muscle and whole-body
protein homeostasis is compromised as the severity of energy deficit increases beyond 40% of daily
energy needs, as a greater proportion of dietary amino acids are oxidized for energy production,
thereby minimizing amino acid availability to support protein balance [ 26] (figure 1). however,
most adults rarely experience acute or sustained periods of severe energy deficit, except for perhaps
acute fasting for religious reasons, poorly-constructed drastic weight loss plans, preparation and /or
recovery from bariatric surgery, or scenarios where food availability is severely limited (e.g., victimsnutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 5 of 13
of natural disasters, emergency responders, etc.). regardless of the cause, these periods of severe
energy deficit usually manifest only for short durations (e.g., 1–3 days) and, therefore, are likely
physiologically tolerable. however, if energy expenditures are high and dietary energy and protein
intake are limited for extended periods of time, for example during sustained, multi-stressor military
operations [ 27,28], the consequences of severe energy deficit are much more problematic, especially
if body mass and fat-free mass loss are so severe that immune system and muscle function and
performance are compromised [ 29–31]. during those conditions, prioritizing energy intake, more so
than focusing solely on protein per se, is vitally important to help prevent excessive muscle catabolism
and conserve muscle function and performance. with moderate energy deficit, however, protein
intakes on the order of double the current rda (i.e., 1.6 g /kg/d) have proved e cacious in preserving
muscle mass during weight loss .
2.4. pathophysiological conditions
inadequate dietary protein intake challenges muscle and whole-body protein balance
(i.e., protein synthesis =protein breakdown), negatively impacting muscle mass, function, adaptations
to exercise, bone and calcium homeostasis, immune system response, fluid and electrolyte balance,
enzyme production and activity, and hormone synthesis. in the absence of su cient dietary protein
intake, muscle is catabolized to provide amino acids to allow for continued endogenous protein synthesis
in critical physiological tissues and organs [ 32] (figure 1). certain pathophysiological conditions,
such as burns [ 33], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) [ 34], human immunodeficiency
virus /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (hiv /aids) [ 35], cancer [ 36], and sepsis [ 37], also challenge
protein homeostasis, albeit the etiology and mechanisms for disrupted protein balance are generally
much di erent from those in healthy adults [ 38]. nevertheless, these conditions often induce
muscle wasting, suggesting that greater dietary protein intakes may be warranted, with specific
recommendations based on the individual patient and clinical scenario.
while much focus has been placed on adult protein needs in the context of these disease
states, the potential benefits of higher-protein intakes extend across the lifespan. muscle loss and
failure-to-thrive are particularly worrisome in the pediatric population, a time typically characterized by
rapid growth and development. recent meta-analysis shows that higher protein intakes in critically ill
pediatric patients are associated with positive protein balance, improved clinical outcomes, and lower
mortality [ 39]. these e ects manifest at intakes above 1.1 g /kg/d and become more prominent
when protein intakes exceed 1.5 g /kg/d. similarly, unintentional weight loss and decrements in
muscle mass in the elderly are predictive of morbidity and mortality, particularly in institutionalized
populations [ 40–42]. provision of dietary protein at or above 1.2 g /kg/d is associated with reductions
in unintentional weight loss [ 43]. dietary protein supplementation, bringing daily protein intake to
1.5 g/kg, may also be beneficial in mitigating the detrimental body composition changes and muscle
mass and function losses associated with sarcopenia [ 44]. similarly, consideration should be made
for the timing and method of delivery, with isolated, intact proteins providing for a greater anabolic
response than mixed meals [ 45]. while advanced age does limit the postprandial anabolic response
typically observed subsequent to protein feeding [ 46,47], regular intakes above the current protein
rda and consumption of at least 0.4 g /kg (i.e., 0.6 g /kg lean body mass) high quality protein at each
meal appear to be critical contributors to preservation of muscle mass and strength that may limit
frailty in older populations [ 42,46,48]. there is also some evidence to support the notion that even
higher protein intakes (e.g., 70 g per meal) may be of benefit, in terms of suppressing whole-body
proteolysis and enhancing net protein balance [49,50].
3. protein misconceptions and reality
while the popularity of dietary protein has increased over the past decade or longer, largely because
of its role in muscle health, there are still some in the media, clinical practice, and within academia [ 51]
that perpetuate certain risks associated with the protein content of balanced mixed-diets for healthynutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 6 of 13
adults. common criticisms of greater protein intakes, or with the types of foods dietary protein is
derived from, include the potential for detrimental e ects of protein on bone, renal function, low-grade
inflammation, cardiometabolic disease, and cancer risk. these concerns are generally unfounded with
regard to the protein content of the diet and are antithetical to contemporary published data [ 52–59].
their persistence, however, and the mislabeling of health detriments to protein itself, as opposed to
the whole foods which contribute protein to the overall diet, may underlie lower dietary intakes and
thereby contribute to suboptimal muscle integrity. while these associations have been corrected in the
scientific literature, other concerns do warrant thoughtful consideration and should be debated in the
context of whole foods rather than just ascribing protein foods to labels of “non-dairy animal,” “dairy,”
and “plant,” without consideration of the other nutrients these foods provide and their possible links
to health and disease .
observations of hypercalciuria from nearly a century ago in those consuming greater amounts of
meat raised concerns that higher protein intakes resulted in increased bone resorption and, therefore,
diminished bone mineral density [ 61]. it was later hypothesized that greater intakes of sulfur-containing
amino acids induce an acidemia that leads to increased bone resorption and calcium release from
bone as a compensatory mechanism to bu er reductions in ph secondary to higher protein intake [ 2].
more recent data suggest that this conclusion is false, as well-controlled studies using stable isotope
tracer techniques to assess calcium absorption have shown that the observed hypercalciuria secondary
to higher protein intake results from increased calcium bioavailability and greater intestinal calcium
absorption potentiated by protein [ 62,63]. data from nhanes show that dietary acid load and bone
mineral density are not related in adults who consume adequate calcium [ 64]. in fact, higher protein
diets may actually protect against osteoporosis, in part, as a result of the increased hepatic release of
insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) [ 65]. a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that those with the
highest protein intakes had significantly lower hip fracture incidence relative to those with the lowest
protein intakes, supporting the assertion that increased dietary protein intake may be protective and
serve a critical role in accruing and maintaining bone mineral density [ 66]. the national osteoporosis
foundation recognizes the potential benefit of dietary protein on bone, while advocating for continued
research, particularly the execution of randomized controlled trials that account for dietary calcium
intake .
higher-protein diets have also been labeled as damaging to the kidneys. increased amino
acid intake can potentiate renal workload and should be reduced in the presence of established
renal disease. however, otherwise healthy kidneys are well-capable of adapting to protein intakes
above the rda and within the amdr. the kidneys are faced with increased nitrogenous waste as
more amino acids are oxidized for energy and /or directed towards gluconeogenesis as the relative
percentage of energy intake derived from protein increases. in a recent evaluation of nhanes data,
protein intake was directly associated with blood urea nitrogen (bun) concentrations, but those in the
highest decile for protein intake (~1.4 g /kg/d) still exhibited normal bun (14.8 0.3; reference range,
7–20 mg /dl) [ 9]. this finding held true across non-dairy animal, animal, and plant protein sources and
neither glomerular filtration rate (gfr) nor blood creatinine concentrations were related to dietary
protein content. similarly, a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with dietary protein
interventions showed a small but positive relationship between higher protein intakes (i.e., 1.5 g/kg/d
or20% energy intake) and gfr [ 52]. overall, current available data suggest higher-protein diets
do increase renal workload, but they do not negatively impact kidney health nor increase the risk of
developing chronic kidney disease in healthy adults.
recent studies have raised concerns about the potential for higher-protein intakes to increase
systemic inflammation. one large-scale investigation showed that those in the greatest high-sensitivity
c-reactive protein (hs-crp) serum concentration quartile also had higher relative protein intakes
than the lowest hs-crp quartile [ 68]. however, the mean di erences in absolute and energy-adjusted
protein intakes between the highest and lowest hs-crp quartiles were only 1.0 and 1.2 g /d, respectively.
similarly, a large controlled dietary intervention study showed greater reductions in hs-crp withnutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 7 of 13
lower-protein intakes (i.e., 10–15% vs. 23–28% total energy intake), although this protein-based
dierence was observed only in conjunction with a high-glycemic index diet and not with a low-glycemic
index background [ 69]. in contrast, an analysis of the framingham heart study o spring cohort
shows an inverse association between dietary protein intake and inflammation and oxidative stress
scores, derived from measures of nine inflammatory biomarkers [ 59]. this potential beneficial e ect
was observed for higher total and animal protein intakes but was even more pronounced with higher
plant protein intakes.
concern has also been raised regarding potential connections between dietary protein intake
and risk of cardiometabolic disease and cancer. these associations are typically confounded
by misrepresentation of foods labeled as “protein-rich” which may, by their nature, be overall
less-healthful nutrient-sparse food options, providing high amounts of total and saturated fats
and processing additives (e.g., nitrates, nitrites, sodium) [ 60]. to the best of our knowledge,
there are no data demonstrating a well-defined association between dietary protein itself and
cardiovascular disease [70,71] or type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 56]. similarly, methionine restriction
(e.g., vegan dietary pattern) may be a viable approach to limit carcinogenic processes and tumor
growth [ 72,73], yet meta-analyses show no link between overall dietary protein intake and incidence
of colorectal [ 57] or breast [ 58] cancers. higher protein intakes may, however, exert a protective e ect
on post-diagnosis survival [ 74]. a greater emphasis must be placed on dietary protein consumption in
the context of overall nutrient-dense, healthy food choices when considering relations to health and
disease, as the aforementioned potential connections are influenced heavily by food item quality more
so than macronutrient profile [55,75].
4. translation and application
an assessment of national dietary patterns shows that protein food intakes have remained
relatively unchanged over the past decade (i.e., 5.79 ounce equivalents (2005–2006), 5.58 (2007–2008),
5.74 (2009–2010), 5.70 (2011–2012), 5.83 (2013–2014), 5.80 (2015–2016)), as intake data for the latest
2-year cycle are nearly identical to those from 10 years earlier [ 76–81]. this static intake pattern may
relate to the regular presentation of recommended protein intakes in a g /d format [ 82,83], calculated
from anthropometrics assumed when the rda was crafted in 2005 (i.e., 70 kg male, 57 kg female [ 2]),
despite the fact that contemporary measures are significantly di erent (i.e., 90 kg average male, 77 kg
average female [ 84]). a present-day, moderately physically active, average adult male, consuming
protein at the rda, would have an intake below the low end of the amdr while maintaining
energy balance. in reality, most american adults consume ~14–16% of total energy as protein
(1.0–1.5 g /kg/d, depending on age and sex) [ 10]; an amount greater than the current rda, but supported
as beneficial to muscle and overall health by contemporary research. in fact, the healthy vegetarian,
healthy mediterranean-style, and healthy u.s.-style eating patterns promoted in the 2015 dietary
guidelines for americans equate to protein intakes 1.55-, 1.94-, and 1.98-fold greater than the current
rda, respectively (theoretical 19–50 year old female consuming 2000 kcal /d) . if the american
adult population, as a whole, consumed protein at approximately 1.6 g /kg/d, as advocated in a recent
review from one of the more prominent laboratory groups in this field [ 5], this would still represent
an approximate 17–19% of total energy intake, certainly reasonable based on the current amdr for
protein. indeed, even increasing to 2.5–3.0 g /kg/d would still fall within the 10–35% of total energy from
protein suggested by the amdr and would provide ample opportunity to optimize muscle health.
in addition to the dietary protein and skeletal muscle considerations, the protein leverage
hypothesis suggests that protein under-consumption increases appetite drive in an e ort to ensure
sucient amino acid intake [ 86]. the unfortunate e ect of this response in the absence of increased
protein intake is excess energy consumption and resultant positive energy balance. the fact that over
120 million americans have some type of cardiovascular disease [ 87], over 29 million are believed
to have type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 88], and approximately 5–7% of the young adult population meets
the diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome [ 89] illustrates the need to change how we structurenutrients 2019 ,11, 1136 8 of 13
feeding recommendations and encourage compliance with dietary guidance. improper application of
the protein rda in federal policy, which informs institutional feeding practices, can result in dietary
protein intakes that may be sub-optimal for muscle growth and preservation and overall health. as an
example, the national school lunch act (section 17(o)(1)) requires that participating programs provide
“approximately one-third of the daily recommended dietary allowance” [ 90]. in practice, this means
that american school children are required to be provided with one-third of the minimum amount of
dietary protein needed to prevent dysfunction, rather than one-third of the amount which may best
support muscle mass, growth, and health. given the relative cost of protein-rich foods and concerns
for cost-e ciency amongst school breakfast and lunch program administrators [ 91], it is reasonable to
expect that protein o erings are reflective of the minimum requirement, rather than robust provision
for optimal health.
certainly, food choices within macronutrient recommendations are critical, with a needed
emphasis on nutrient-dense selections [ 92]. similarly, we recognize the traditional association between
higher-protein diets and higher meat consumption and the much-needed focus on sustainability
and the potential environmental impact of our food sources. with these in mind, we strongly
encourage the reevaluation of macronutrient recommendations to best reflect high quality science,
basing them on experimental studies over observational data [ 93]. implementing reliable macronutrient
recommendations for both healthy and diseased populations at all stages of the lifecycle, which engender
consumer confidence, can then be followed by greater emphasis on quality food choices within those
guidelines. such action would allow for dietary protein recommendations, and resultant public health
policy, best designed to provide for muscle accretion, quality, and preservation throughout the lifespan.
a realignment of macronutrient intake recommendations with contemporary research findings would
create the foundation for advances in public health.

skeletal muscle is a highly plastic tissue, able to remodel in response to its physical demands.
this includes growth (i.e., hypertrophy) in response to the applic ation of external forces (e.g.,
exercise) and loss (i.e., atrophy) in response to the withdraw al of these forces (e.g., detraining,
immobilization).givenitscentralroleinconvertingchem icalenergytomechanicalwork,skeletal
muscle is unquestionably important for individuals wishing t o excel in athletic competition,
effectively navigate rehabilitation settings (e.g., return t o play, remobilization after injury), and
perform activities of daily living (e.g., maintain function al independence with age). however, this
tissueisamajorcontributortothebasalmetabolicrateand isthepreferredstoragedepotfordietary
sugars and fats, which positions it as a vital tissue for the ma intenance of metabolic health. thus,
maintaining an adequate quantity and quality of skeletal mus cle is important for optimal health
andperformancethroughoutthelifespan.
thisrecentspecialissueon“nutritionalstrategiestopromo temusclemassandfunctionacross
the health span” represents a collection of 21 articles, inclu ding 12 original research articles, from
130 of the world leaders in the fields of muscle physiology, nutri tion, and exercise physiology.
a common theme throughout the special issue is the interactiv e effects of muscle contraction
and dietary nutrients, in which exercise can “make nutritio n better” and nutrition can improve
muscle mass and function. for example, oikawa et al. highlighted the importance of maintaining
muscle activity to help stave off the deleterious effects of “ana bolic resistance,” which is the
impaired ability to utilize dietary amino acids to support musc le protein synthesis and tissue
remodeling that ultimately leads to decrements in muscle ma ss and function. importantly, the
authorshighlightthatreduceddailystepcounts,whichcou ldbeinterpretedas“benign”inactivity
in comparison to more severe immobility such as cast, bedrest , and spaceflight, is actually far
more common in today’s society and recapitulates the muscle de conditioning that is evident from
thesemoreextrememodelsofmuscledisuse.thisisanimportan thealthmessagegiventherecent
(as of publication) shelter-at-home practices of ongoing pand emics (1). however, some potential
nutritional strategies to minimize the loss of muscle mass a nd function could include greater
protein intake (as suggested by oikawa et al. ), increased polyunstaturated fatty acids (pufa’s, as
suggested by mcglory et al. ), and/or creatine supplementation (as highlighted by candow et al. ),
all of which may have greater efficacy in populations already at ri sk for low muscle mass and/or
function such as the elderly and/or pre/post-operative patient s. this discussion was also extended
bybeaudry and devries who highlighted the potential benefit of dietary protein (and po tentially
thatwhichisdairy-based)andexercise(especiallyresista nceexercise)incounteringthemetabolicmoore and philp editorial: nutrition for functional muscle mass
dysregulation and low muscle quality common to clinical
populationssuchaspre-diabetic(pd)andtypeiidiabetic(t2d)
individuals. incidentally, the original research of sambashivaiah
et al.reported lower muscle strength, but not mass, in pd and
t2d asian indians compared to healthy controls, suggesting
additionalresearchintothehabitualactivityanddietary practices
of pre- and clinical populations is warranted. finally, obesit y
was discussed as a potential direct modulator of the anabolic
resistance of skeletal muscle to both exercise and dietary pr otein
bybeals et al. , especially in conjunction with inactivity. thus,
these summative reviews represent important information for
academics,knowledgetranslators,andknowledgeend-user s(e.g.,
clinicians and therapists) when identifying synergistic di etary
and activity factors to maintain muscle mass and quality in
vulnerablepopulations.
dietary protein represents a primary nutrient for the
remodeling of muscle tissue given its ability to independent ly
stimulate muscle protein synthesis ( 2). however, gwin et al.
also demonstrated in healthy young adults entering militar y
service that higher habitual protein intakes are associated with
greateroveralldietaryqualityandmicronutrientingesti on,which
generally supports previous recommendations that position
nutrient dense, protein-rich whole foods as critical to main tain
muscle health ( 3). aside from total protein intake, smeuninx
et al.provided further evidence that individuals both young and
old in the united kingdom consume their daily protein in a
skewed manner, highlighting the potential that redistribut ing
protein from the larger evening meals to the morning may
optimize muscle protein remodeling, providing a more efficient
means to consume the daily protein intake. snijders et al.
also provided a comprehensive summary of the ability of pre-
sleep protein ingestion to enhance nocturnal rates of muscle
protein synthesis as a means to promote tissue remodeling
and growth. interestingly, the authors retrospectively asse ssed
research from the van loon laboratory at maastricht universi ty
and demonstrated that greater protein intakes than that whic h
maximize muscle protein synthesis in daytime meals (i.e., ∼0.25
g/kg) (4) can dose-dependently (at least up to ∼0.6 g/kg)
support higher nocturnal muscle protein synthetic rates. this
could suggest that a greater provision of amino acid substrat es
during an otherwise overnight fasted period are required to
maximizemuscleproteinsynthesisoveran ∼8hsleepingperiod
as compared to a daytime 4–6h postprandial period. this
apparentlygreaterabilitytoassimilatedietaryproteinuptak einto
skeletal muscle during the overnight period could also explai n
in part the lack of difference in mixed muscle protein synthesis

free placebo consumed prior to bed ( ∼2100h) despite a positive
∼10-hwholebodynetproteinbalance,asreportedinthisspecial
issue by karagounis et al. . thus, daily protein redistribution
independent of additional supplemental intake may represent a
feasible means to optimize muscle mass and quality, especially if
itarisesfromnutrient-densesources.

the aging of much of the world’s population ( 5), older adults
represent a prime target for the development of strategies tomaintainmusclehealth.attheforefrontofnutritionalstr ategies,
protein intakes greater than the current recommended dietar y
allowance (rda; 0.8 g/kg/d) are being advocated by many as a
means to battle sarcopenia ( 6,7). in this issue, durainayagam
et al.demonstrated that consuming twice the rda for 10-week
alters the metabolome in a manner that could be consistent
with supporting increased tissue anabolism. with a growing
interest in identifying responder phenotypes for personalized
therapies, these results, if leveraged in larger cohorts, cou ld
serve as a springboard into additional trials that could advan ce
this scientific and therapeutic aim. further research from
the cameron-smith lab as published by d’souza et al. also

synthesis may function to both resynthesize any old/damage d
proteins broken down during the process of protein turnover
as well as build new muscle proteins, optimizing this process
in the elderly through exercise and/or nutritional approaches
is of paramount importance for older adults. original research
by the phillips laboratory, as presented by bell et al. ostensibly
supports this contention as integrated (i.e., “free-living” ) rates
of myofibrillar protein synthesis in overweight older adults
over 24h of post-exercise recovery were both enhanced with a

issue provides important contributions to research and clinic al
endeavors that aim to maintain muscle mass and function
withage.

(e.g., increased strength) are prime goals of many active
individuals and especially athletes. the review by slater et al.
provides an excellent overview of the energy requirements
for muscle hypertrophy as they discuss the variety of factors
that must be considered when identifying the “sweet spot”,
or minimum requirement, that both maximizes the growth of
lean tissue with little to no concomitant fat mass growth. it
is clear that ascribing to a “see-food” diet (i.e., unrestra ined

however, the authors highlight that current evidence sugge sts

a reasonable daily target to support muscle growth, although

they demonstrated that some measures of muscle strength (i. e.,
1-repetition maximum knee extension) increased with fish oil
with no concomitant retention of whole body fat-free mass
during energy restriction. this research highlights the pot ential
for n-3 pufas to be an adjuvant therapy for athletes aiming to
maintain muscle function during targeted weight loss, possi bly
viaenhancedneuromuscularfunction.
in addition to adequate energy, it is important to also
consume adequate dietary protein to provide the amino acid
substratestosupportmuscleproteinremodelingandnetprotein
synthesis during the post-exercise recovery period. a review in
this issue ( moore) provides evidence that ∼0.3g of protein/kg
bodymassrepresentsadosethatmaximizesmyofibrillarprotein
synthesisyetwouldminimizeexcessaminoacidoxidativelo sses.
importantly, there is no evidence this target is influenced
by sex or total active muscle mass ( moore), which increases
the ease of translation across a range of body masses as
compared to previous studies that provided absolute protein
doses (8,9). however, special consideration may need to be
made for athletes engaging in very high volume (i.e., up to 32
sets/muscle group per training session) resistance trainin g as
gains in lbm over 6-weeks in trained males were enhanced
by graded (i.e., from 25 to 150 g/day) whey protein ingestion
(haun et al. ). this potentially highlights the need for additional
research in highly active individuals who are not the typical
untrained or recreationally active populations common to mos t
basic/foundational research in this area. original resear ch from
edman et al. demonstrated that activation of mtorc1 (i.e.,
altered phosphorylation of s6k1 and eef2) after exercise with

abstract: personalized nutrition may be more effective in changing lifestyle behaviors compared to
population-based guidelines. this single-arm exploratory study evaluated the impact of a 10-week
personalized systems nutrition (psn) program on lifestyle behavior and health outcomes. healthy
men and women ( n= 82) completed the trial. individuals were grouped into seven diet types, for
which phenotypic, genotypic and behavioral data were used to generate personalized recommenda-
tions. behavior change guidance was also provided. the intervention reduced the intake of calories
( 256.2 kcal; p< 0.0001), carbohydrates (  22.1 g; p< 0.0039), sugar ( 13.0 g; p< 0.0001), total fat
( 17.3 g; p< 0.0001), saturated fat (  5.9 g; p= 0.0003) and pufa (  2.5 g; p= 0.0065). addition-
ally, bmi ( 0.6 kg/m2;p< 0.0001), body fat (  1.2%; p= 0.0192) and hip circumference (  5.8 cm;
p< 0.0001 ) were decreased after the intervention. in the subgroup with the lowest phenotypic flex-
ibility, a measure of the body’s ability to adapt to environmental stressors, ldl (  0.44 mmol/l;
p= 0.002) and total cholesterol (  0.49 mmol/l; p< 0.0001) were reduced after the intervention.
this study shows that a psn program in a workforce improves lifestyle habits and reduces body
weight, bmi and other health-related outcomes. health improvement was most pronounced in the
compromised phenotypic flexibility subgroup, which indicates that a psn program may be effective
in targeting behavior change in health-compromised target groups.

1. introduction
public health dietary recommendations are designed to help a majority of the popula-
tion avoid chronic disease. personalization of these recommendations is limited to gender
and age [ 1]. however, people also differ in genotype, phenotype, behavior, personality
and socio-psychological environment. due to these differences, personal variation in re-
sponse to dietary recommendations is likely. indeed, research has shown that responses
to nutritional interventions depend on differences in both genotype and phenotype [ 2–4].
tailoring advice based on individual data also increases the perceived relevance of this
advice [ 5]. additionally, awareness of potential health problems leads to more favorable
attitudes toward personalized nutrition [ 6,7]. workforce wellness programs appear to be

more effective if the content is tailored to participants’ needs [ 8]. thus, personalized nutri-
tion approaches may be more effective in changing dietary and other lifestyle behaviors,
ultimately improving health outcomes, as compared to guidelines derived for the majority
of the population [9–12].
personalized nutrition has been defined as “the use of individual-specific information,
founded in evidence-based science, to promote dietary behavior change that may result
in measurable health benefits” [ 13]. the effectiveness of personalized nutrition programs
can be enhanced by using an integrated systems-based approach [ 14]. a four-step cycle of
personalized nutrition was designed to improve and sustain health and function by com-
bining objective health data and behavior change to meet individual needs and goals [ 13].
this cycle starts with collecting individual-specific information, which may range from
an individual’s current lifestyle and personal preferences to phenotype and genotype. in
general, the level of personalization is dependent on the robustness and extensiveness of
the available data [ 15]. the second step in the cycle is to translate individual data into
evidence-based dietary recommendations. this requires the identification of food-health
relationships using scientific knowledge and/or algorithms that can link individual data
to dietary advice. furthermore, it requires integration with a person’s needs, context and
preferences to promote understanding, adherence and sustained behavior change [16,17].
the third component of the personalized nutrition cycle is to further promote dietary
behavior change through the application of behavior change techniques, such as goal-
setting, self-monitoring and positive feedback, which have been proven to be effective in
increasing the likelihood of behavior change [ 18–21]. it has been shown previously that
combining multiple approaches unique to the individual, including face-to-face contact,
increases effectiveness [ 22–26]. personalized behavior change support should also take
into account readiness and motivation to change [ 17]. regarding goal-setting, intrinsic
motivation to achieve the goal and freedom in choosing goals are important determinants
for success, both in the short and long term [27–29].
the fourth component of the personalized nutrition cycle measures the success of the
advice and behavior change support; quantifiable improvements in health are essential.
as personalized nutrition approaches strive to become more individualized and holistic,
measuring the effects of such interventions demands an outcome measure that considers
multiple aspects of health. a holistic definition of health has been defined by huber et al.
as “the ability to adapt or cope with ever changing environmental conditions” [ 30,31].
the ability of the metabolic system to recognize an environmental challenge, respond,
and return to homeostasis is referred to as phenotypic flexibility [ 32]. an unhealthy
lifestyle is known to impair phenotypic flexibility and may negatively affect health [ 32].
for example, impaired phenotypic flexibility has been reported in overweight participants
who have a reduced ability to metabolize stored lipids for energy synthesis and adapt
more slowly to excess dietary fat intake, compared with lean participants [ 33]. assessment
of phenotypic flexibility can be used as a measure of metabolic health status to inform
nutritional interventions [ 34–36]. the assessment of phenotypic flexibility requires the
perturbation of homeostasis and subsequent evaluation of nutrition-related biomarkers.
a nutrition challenge (i.e., tolerance tests) with a combination of fat, carbohydrates and
protein has been successfully used to disturb homeostasis [ 33,34]. drawing conclusions on
the metabolic health status of an individual based on single biomarkers is challenging as
it may provide an incomplete picture; thus, an aggregate marker could be calculated by
integrating multiple metabolic markers into a composite score [37,38].
the objective of the current study was to determine the impact of an integrated per-
sonalized systems nutrition (psn) program in a workforce. the psn program included
personalized dietary advice based on individual phenotype (challenge test response),
genotype, and anthropometric data in combination with participant-generated data on
diet, physical activity, goals, and preferences. the personalized dietary advice was pro-
vided via recipes and macro- and micronutrient recommendations, but also in the form of
ready-made meals (breakfast and lunches). the psn program included behavior guidancenutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 3 of 28
through individual coaching and motivational interviewing and behavior change promo-
tion through goal setting, positive feedback and self-monitoring. the effect of this 10-week
psn program on lifestyle behavior change, including dietary intake, activity, and sleep,
was evaluated. furthermore, the effect of this program on health outcomes, including
individual markers and an aggregate score for metabolic health status (i.e., health space
model) was also evaluated [39,40].
2. materials and methods
2.1. study design
this was a single-arm, multi-phase, open-label exploratory trial that consisted of four
10-week periods preceded by a screening session (week  2). each of the periods had a
mid- and end-point visit: (i) baseline (week 0) and run-in (week 0–10), (ii) intervention
phase 1: personalized coaching/advice and meals (week 10 to 20), (iii) intervention phase 2:
personalized coaching/advice (week 20 to 30), (iv) follow-up (week 30 to 40, endpoint visit
only). the focus of this manuscript is on the methods and main results from data collected
at baseline, during run-in and in phase 1 of the study, i.e., through week 20 (figure 1).
due to a higher-than-expected dropout from phase 2, these data were excluded from the
analysis. the study was conducted in accordance with good clinical practice guidelines,
the declaration of helsinki [ 41], and the united states 21 code of federal regulations.
an institutional review board (hummingbird irb, needham, ma, usa) approved the
protocol before initiation of the study, and participants provided written informed consent
before implementation of any study-specific procedures. this study was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (accessed on 18 march 2021) as nct03424395, which includes details of
the study design and outcomes assessed.

2.2. participants
generally healthy men and women, 30 to 65 years of age, with body mass index (bmi)
18.5 to 39.9 kg/m2were recruited from a workforce (campbell soup company, camden, nj,
usa). eligibility was assessed via a screening questionnaire (week  2). eligible participants
were those who met the inclusion criteria, were willing to follow all study procedures
and who had access to an internet-ready device and a functioning personal email address.
participants were deemed ineligible based on the following exclusion criteria: a history or
presence of diagnosed conditions that could interfere with study outcomes, uncontrolled
hypertension, a current or recent history of nicotine or heavy alcohol use (>14 drinks per
week), current or recent use of lipid altering medications, allergy or sensitivity to the study
foods provided or very specific dietary habits (e.g., vegan, very low carbohydrate), or
a recent history of body weight change >10%. a complete description of all inclusion
and exclusion criteria can be found on clinicaltrials.gov (accessed on 18 march 2021)
(nct03424395).
2.3. study procedures overview
at each visit, anthropometrics (height (first visit only), weight, fat mass, waist and
hip circumference) [ 42] and blood pressure were assessed according to standard operating
procedures by the study coordinator.
validated questionnaires were administered electronically (redcap cloud, version
1.3, encinitas, ca, usa) in weeks 0 (baseline), 10, 15 and 20. additionally, participants
were provided with an activity tracker at baseline (charge 2, fitbit, san francisco, ca,
usa) and were asked to wear the device for the remainder of the study.
in weeks 0, 10 and 20, participants were provided with an at-home kit including all
necessities for challenge testing and dried blood spot (dbs) and dna (week 0 only) sample
collections. prior to testing at baseline, participants were provided with private access to a
digital platform which included video instructions and an on-boarding form for logging
age, body weight and height, hypertension status (yes or no), waist circumference and
physical activity history. data from this form was used along with clinical and dna results
to generate personalized recommendations.
personalized recommendations were provided to participants through a digital plat-
form on week 10. additionally, breakfast and lunch meals were provided and tailored to
their macronutrient recommendations, five days a week for nine weeks, starting at week
10. meal diaries were collected weekly to assess compliance. video and phone coaching
sessions were scheduled with participants in weeks 10, 15 and 20. adverse events were
evaluated at the beginning of each visit, except at screening.
2.4. at-home sample collection and challenge test
participants were instructed to avoid vigorous physical activity and fast for 10 to 14 h
(water only) prior to completing the at-home kit. sample collection began with buccal cell
collection by cheek swab (week 0 only for dna isolation) followed by fasting capillary
blood (0 min). challenge beverages were then consumed within a 5-min time period and
capillary blood collected at 30- and 120-min post-beverage consumption. all capillary
blood was collected on dbs cards (advance dx100, advance dx, inc., chicago, il, usa).
participants placed their dbs cards and cheek swabs in packets and brought them to the
study office where they were logged and shipped for analysis (aegis sciences corporation
nashville, tn, usa).
a nutrient dense mixed-meal beverage was used for challenge testing, which has
been previously shown to effectively perturb metabolic homeostasis [ 43]. the challenge
beverage (414 ml; jasper products, joplin, mo, usa) consisted of 60.1% ( w/w) water, 13.6%
(w/w) palm oil, 18.9% ( w/w) dextrose, 5.3% ( w/w) milk protein isolate, and < 1.5% each of
vanilla, cassia flavor, trisodium citrate, canola lecithin, and gellan gum. this resulted in a
beverage of 3950 kj/950 kcal with a macronutrient composition of ~64 g fat, 22 g protein
and 88 g carbohydrate.nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 5 of 28
2.5. personalized systems nutrition program
decision trees and algorithms were used to generate personalized dietary recommen-
dations using individual on-boarding data (including self-reported body weight, waist
circumference and blood pressure), clinical measures (including measures before and
after a mixed-meal challenge test) and single nucleotide polymorphism (snp) variants
(table 1 ) according to the proposed guidelines to evaluate scientific validity and evidence
for genotype based dietary advice [ 44]. snps indicated in bold (table 1) drove personalized
dietary recommendations if the risk-variants of these snps coincided with an unhealthy
phenotype. all other snps were only used to help provide additional context and sup-
porting recommendations (supplementary table s1). individuals were grouped into seven
possible personalized diet types (pdts) that differed in terms of phenotypic flexibility
(a = highest possible flexibility to g = lowest flexibility). personalized advice for these
pdts differed in terms of macronutrient profiles that met the usda dietary guidelines
for americans [ 1] and/or acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges [ 45] (table 2).
pdts were determined using onboarding data and clinical measures. snps did not inde-
pendently determine diet type. if a risk variant for fto rs9939609 coincided with a high
waist circumference, this led to a high protein and low fat and carb pdt [ 46–48]. energy
intake advice was determined based on total energy expenditure. the basal metabolic rate
was calculated using the mifflin st. jeor equation [ 49], which was then multiplied by the
daily physical activity level (pal) score. the total daily pal was calculated as the sum
of the daily pattern pal score based on a categorization by hall et al. and pal scores for
sport and leisure activities [ 50,51]. micronutrient recommendations were determined using
onboarding, anthropometric and clinical measures and further supported by snp data if
physiological pathways were known. for instance, it has been shown that in hypertensive
people with the mthfr rs1801133 risk variant riboflavin supplementation may contribute
to blood pressure lowering [ 52,53]. finally, snp-based narratives were provided for a few
food-related sensitivities, physical activity and vitamin d, which describe the linkages
between the snp and certain recommendations or health outcomes, but do not imply
causality (table s1).

in addition to the seven pdts that guide macronutrient recommendations, the algo-
rithms generated micronutrient and calorie recommendations. micronutrient recommen-
dations were personalized by age and gender (per u.s. rdas), dietary intake, clinical
measures and snp data [54,55].
finally, participants were provided with personalized recipes and meals according
to their macro- and micronutrient recommendations [ 56]. participants had access to a
digital platform which included their personalized recommendations, test results and
narratives explaining the participant’s clinical, genotypic and anthropometric data. addi-
tional information on the decision trees and algorithms that were used can be provided
upon request.
coaching by a registered dietitian nutritionist (rdn) occurred three times for phase 1
(week 10 to 20) (figure 1). rdns were trained on coaching techniques as well as the
algorithms behind the psn program prior to the start of phase 1. coaching sessions were
provided by two rdns who jointly developed the format of the sessions based on behavior
science and held, at minimum, bi-weekly conference calls to review content for participants’
sessions. during the first coaching session (week 10), which was a video conference, the
rdn explained their clinical results to each participant and how they were linked to their
personalized dietary recommendations. additionally, readiness to change and self-efficacynutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 9 of 28
were explored [ 57,58]. after the first coaching session, participants were instructed to
set personal goals for at least one goal area (modifying eating behavior, exercise, sleep,
general balance and mindfulness) using smart (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic,
time-based) goal setting criteria [ 59]. to provide participants with a foundation for change,
they were shown graphics and data during their session comparing their present reported
dietary macro- and micronutrient intakes to their personalized program recommendations.
participants were provided the graphics and data electronically after the session for refer-
ence. additionally, they were provided with food recommendations and considerations
to help them achieve their program plan. during the second coaching session (week 11),
delivered by phone, personalized behavior change smart goals using the smart criteria
were reviewed and finalized. during the third coaching session (week 15) participants
could touch base on goals or other issues related to their personalized program. partic-
ipants where shown their most recent food intake data compared to the personalized
recommendations. individual’s chosen goals were reviewed to assess their progress and
adjust behavior change as needed. this was followed by an electronically delivered report
recapping the session. coaches used motivational interviewing strategies and techniques
to facilitate behavior change at all sessions and contacts [ 57,58]. in addition to coaching,
throughout phase 1, participants received information on how to follow their personalized
diet via email and on their digital platform. this information included guidance on meals
and snacks, eating out, and recipes for their pdt.
2.6. study meals and compliance
participants received tailored breakfast and lunch five days a week for nine weeks,
beginning at week 10. all meals were prepared on-site (sodexo food services, gaithersburg,
md, usa) according to macronutrient distributions per assigned pdt (table 1). when
possible, food preferences were accommodated. participants were provided with meal
diaries weekly and asked to record how much of each meal they consumed. responses
were scored as follows: ‘i did not eat’ (0), ‘ 50%’ (0.5), or’50%’ (1) and compliance was
calculated as the percentage of meals consumed based on the number of meals provided.
2.7. dietary intake
participants recorded all food and beverage intake consumed over three days (two
weekdays and one weekend day) using a standard dietary record methodology prior to all
visits except for the screening and week 5 visits [ 60]. at randomization, participants were
instructed on how to collect dietary recalls, and shown household measuring cups, spoons
and a ruler, and instructed on how to obtain portion sizes on labels. the records were
reviewed by an rdn who followed up by email if clarification was required. records were
analyzed using food processor nutrition analysis software (version 11.6, esha, salem,
or, usa) and nutrient intake and calories were averaged over the three days and used for
statistical analyses.
2.8. anthropometrics and vitals
at each visit, anthropometrics (height (first visit only), weight, fat mass, waist and hip
circumference) and blood pressure were assessed. duplicate measures for body weight
and fat were obtained using the bc-554 ironman®body composition monitor (tanita,
arlington heights, il, usa) according to standard methodology as provided by the tanita
bc-554 scale. the tanita bc-554 model has single frequency bioelectrical impedance
analysis technology to assess changes in body fat and fat mass over time. the same tanita
scale was used for all participants throughout the entire duration of the study. our protocol
aimed to control for the effects of hydration state, body temperature, and time of day
on measurements by educating participants on hydration status and conducting clinic
visits at similar times. waist and hip circumference were performed by the same study
coordinator following the who standards [ 42]. triplicate measures for blood pressure
(home ™1500 series upper arm blood pressure monitor, welch allyn, chicago, il, usa)nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 10 of 28
were taken according to standard operating procedures and the last two measurements
were averaged.
2.9. wellbeing and lifestyle
dietary behavior was assessed using the validated 34-item adult eating behaviors
questionnaire (aebq) [ 61] which was administered electronically prior to visits at weeks
0 and 20. quality of life (qol) was assessed using the validated 26-item whoqol-bref
questionnaire , which was administered electronically at week 0, 10 and 20.
participants wore an activity tracker (charge 2, fitbit, san francisco, ca, usa) from
week 10 to 20 for assessment of daily activity (heart rate, number of steps) and sleep hours.
data was collected and stored using fitabase (small steps labs, san diego, ca, usa) prior
to analysis.
2.10. laboratory analyses
all laboratory analyses were performed by aegis sciences corporation (nashville, tn,
usa). dna was isolated from buccal samples and analyzed for quantity and quality using
an rnasep assay. a panel of snps, associated with dietary intake-related phenotypes, was
investigated using qpcr on the taqman/life tech platform ™(thermo fisher scientific,
waltham, ma, usa).
a 0.49-inch sample was punched from the serum eluded on the dbs cards. these
cards are designed to separate the serum from cellular components of the whole blood and
thus are subject to hematocrit bias/effect [ 63]. from this sample, serum glucose, triglyc-
erides, total cholesterol and hdl cholesterol were analyzed using enzymatic colorimetric
tests on an olympus 5400 (olympus corporation, tokyo, japan). ldl cholesterol was
calculated using the friedewald equation [ 64]. a standard sandwich elisa kit was used
to assess c-peptide (mercodia, upsala, sweden) using a freedom evo 150 platform fitted
with a columbus microplate washer and sunrise microplate reader (tecan, mannedorf,
switzerland). all test results were normalized to total microprotein concentrations. each
normalized result was projected to a serum concentration using algorithms generated by
aegis sciences corporation.
2.11. calculation of insulin sensitivity indices
the glucose and c-peptide values derived from the challenge tests at all timepoints
were used to calculate the following indices: simple matsuda index and homeostatic
model assessment for insulin resistance (homa-ir) as measures of whole body insulin
resistance [65,66].
2.12. statistical analysis and data management
an evaluable sample of 100 participants was expected to provide 80% power assuming
an alpha = 0.05, two-sided, and an effect size of 0.3 for health space score based on a
previous nutritional intervention study .
a sample of 107 participants was enrolled to account for attrition and/or non-
compliance (figure 2). tests of significance were performed at = 0.01 for questionnaires
and fitbit data and at = 0.05 for all remaining tests. the primary outcome variable
was the health space score. all remaining outcomes were secondary. the analysis was
completed on a per protocol (pp) population, which was defined as follows: completing
coaching session at week 10, and either completing a key questionnaire (whoqol-bref)
or vital signs and anthropometrics, with no major protocol deviations.nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 11 of 28

2.12.1. health space model 
the health space analysis is a multivariate supervised dimension reduction method 
that serves to summarize multiple variables into a single biologically meaningful score. 
ridge regression was the applied method for th e creation of health space models . the 
model is a trained classifier that discrimina tes between two predefined reference groups 
. during the training procedure, 10-fold cross validation was used to find the optimal 
shrinkage parameters for the model as well as to determine model quality using the mis-classification error. the data for each of the variables in the input dataset was centered on 
the mean and scaled by the standard deviation (figure 3). 
the reference groups were taken from previous research which aimed to create a 
health space representative of the normal rang e of health, using the phenotypic flexibility 
concept . on the low end of the spectrum is the young and lean reference group (20 to 
29 years of age, normal body fat percentage, which was <20% in male and <30% in female) 
while the high end of the spectrum is represented by the older group with a higher body 
fat percentage (60 to 70 years of age, body fat percentage ranging from normal to high, which was >20% in male and >30% in female) . the number that is produced by 
providing this model with data from the study participants is termed the ‘health space 
score’. 
in summary, the health space score presented here aligns with the range of metabolic 
states within a normal healthy population. a higher score represents reduced phenotypic 
flexibility and a higher degree of similarity with older people with higher adiposity, while

2.12.2. wellbeing questionnaires an d activity/sleep data analysis 
for the whoqol-bref and the aebq the (sub)scales were calculated ac-
cording to the official guidelines. 
the fitbit data provided information on the number of steps taken, resting heart rate 
and the hours of sleep. for the number of step s taken, the average steps per day over the 
phase preceding the measurement point was used. for resting heart rate and hours of sleep a similar approach was used. 
the questionnaire and fitbit data were ev aluated using a linear mixed effect model 
where the intercept is dependent on the individual; this is akin to a repeated measurement 
model. due to the nature of the data, pdt, gender and timepoint were used as explanatory 
variables. when multiple time points were evaluated, time point was included as a co-variate. the assumptions of linearity, normality and homoscedasticity were checked for 
each significant model. a 0.01 level was used to justify a claim of a statistically significant 
effect. statistical analyses were completed using r software (version 3.5.1; the r founda-
tion, vienna, austria). 
2.12.3. linear mixed model univariate analysis 
all remaining variables were assessed by univariate analysis using linear mixed 
models. for the univariate analysis, linear mixed models were used. all variables were 
log transformed before statistical analysis. a mixed model was used for statistical anal-
ysis. in this model, the focus was on visit an d pdt including its interaction. age, gender 
and cohort were three covariates in the model . in this model age, gender, cohort, visit, 
pdt and pdt × visit were fixed factors. the pa rticipants within a cohort represented the 
random factor. if significant effects were obse rved, post-hoc tests were applied. to correct 
for multiple testing, a tukey–kramer multiple comparison correction was applied on the 
p-values of the post-hoc tests. assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were in-
vestigated by graphical representations on resi duals produced by statistical models. if the 
model residual of any data point was larger than 3 × rmse (root mean squared error) for 
a certain variable, the data point was considered as a statistical outlier for this variable 
and removed from the particular data set befo re creating a new model. for all statistical 
tests using the linear mixed model, a 0.05 level was used to justify a claim of a statistically 
significant effect. the tests conducted were two-sided. this analysis approach was used 
for all data except for the psychological questionnaire and fitbit data. statistical analyses 
were conducted using sas version 9.4 (sas institute inc., cary, nc, usa).

participants mainly selected modifying eating behavior as their primary goal (~56%)
during the coaching sessions, followed by exercise (~33%) and mindfulness (~11%). none
of the participants selected sleep or general balance as a primary goal.
within the pp population, two pdts were mainly represented, which were group a
(n= 48) and group g ( n= 22); only three participants were classified into one of the other
pdt categories (group b, e and f). for this reason, we restricted the discussion to diet
type groups a and g only. as a result of the automated psn algorithms, which assigned
one of seven pdts based on metabolic health status at baseline, groups a and g represent
the most and least phenotypically flexible groups, respectively. group g had a higher
degree of adiposity and a higher age as compared to group a (table 3). no differences in
dietary patterns were observed at baseline between the two pdts. both groups were 82%
compliant with personalized meal intake.
3.2. run-in period effects (qualitative control)
the run-in period (week 0 to 10), which was the same duration as the intervention
period, provides an indication of behavior and health effects of being included in a clinical
study (without being provided with the personalized nutrition program) and served
as a qualitative control. in terms of dietary intake, total fat intake increased (+7.5 g;
p= 0.037) from week 0 to 10 (supplementary table s2). this may be attributed to a higher
intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) (+4.3 g; p= 0.003) and polyunsaturated
fatty acids (pufa) (+2.5 g; p= 0.003). for group g only, there was a decrease in beta-
carotene intake ( 1031 mcg; p= 0.007) (results not shown). additionally, some small
but unfavorable health differences were found. fasting and 2 h c-peptide (+0.11 nmol/l
p= 0.009 resp. +0.25 nmol/l; p= 0.003) as well as 2 h glucose levels (+0.31 mmol/l;
p= 0.042) were elevated after the run-in period. consequently, homa-ir (+26.6%; p= 0.001)
increased, and matsuda index decreased (  15%; p= 0.0004), indicating an increased state
of whole-body insulin resistance.
3.3. intervention effects
3.3.1. dietary intake
many dietary intake changes were observed. for the pp population, intake of calories
( 256.2 kcal; p< 0.0001), carbohydrates (  22.1 g; p= 0.0039), sugar ( 13.0 g; p< 0.0001),
total fat ( 17.3 g; p< 0.0001), saturated fat (sfa) (  5.9 g; p= 0.0003) and pufa (  2.5 g;
p= 0.0065) were reduced during the intervention (week 10 to 20) (table 4 and s2).
energy intake from fat was significantly reduced and there was a small but significant
increase in energy intake from fiber. when looking at differences between the pdt, percent
calories from protein significantly increased in group g and not in group a, reflecting
compliance with personalized dietary advice for these groups (tables 2 and 4).
for micronutrient intake, significant increases were seen during the intervention
period for vitamin c (+33.6 mg; p= 0.0002), magnesium (+47.7 mg; p= 0.0029) and
potassium (+327.4 mg; p= 0.0328) in the pp population. finally, sodium levels were
significantly reduced (  546.0 mg; p= 0.0007). when looking at subgroups, a significant
increase in beta-carotene intake was seen in group g, but not group a.
3.3.2. wellbeing and lifestyle
for the pp population, the total steps per day increased, and the resting heart rate
decreased during the intervention (table 4 and s2).
in terms of eating behavior, the only change observed was a higher satiety response
after a meal in the pp population.
a significant positive correlation between the whoqol physical scale score at week
10 and the number of steps taken during intervention (correlation = 0.447; p< 0.001) was
observed. additionally, a positive correlation between the change in steps over time
(change in steps from run-in period as compared to intervention period) and the whoqol
health scale score at week 10 was observed (correlation = 0.39; p< 0.01).nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 15 of 28

4. discussion 
this study shows that a psn program in a workforce improves dietary habits and 
physical activity and reduces body weight, bmi and other health-related outcomes. these 
changes were most pronounced in group g, the subgroup with a compromised pheno-
typic flexibility at baseline. 
while this study was not designed to prom ote weight loss, the psn program resulted 
in an overall reduction in caloric intake, and an improvement in diet quality, as reflected 
by a decreased intake of total and saturate d fat, sugar and sodium. additionally, a de-
crease in absolute intake of pufa was seen, but as there were no changes in energy per-
centage from pufa, this is likely caused by the reduction in caloric intake. overall, the 
reduction in total and saturated fat intake, su gar and sodium during the intervention pe-
riod reflects an improved diet quality. this is further underscored by improvements in 
micronutrient intake, in terms of increased vitamin c, magnesium, potassium and beta-
carotene intake, suggesting a higher intake of fruits and/or vegetables [69–71]. an increase 
in fruit and vegetable intake is in line with the personalized meals, recipes and sugges-
tions for both subgroups. overall, the nutrie nt data suggests that after the personalized 
intervention, participants showed eating habits that are more aligned with population-based dietary recommendations. when looking at subgroups, the psn program not only 
improved adherence with population-based di etary guidelines, but also better alignment 
with personal needs was achieved. for group g, different positive effects were seen with 
respect to dietary intake, consistent with their respective dietary recommendations. pro-
tein (as a percentage of total energy) and be ta-carotene intake increased during the inter-
vention period in group g, but not in group a. the increase in protein intake can be di-
rectly related to the personalized advice of group g, as they were recommended to con-
sume a diet high in protein and low in carbohydrates and fat. the increase in beta-carotene intake could be the result of a higher intake of fruits and vegetables. it should be noted 
that the personalized ready-made meals for group g were higher in protein and beta-
carotene compared to the meals for group a. these results indicate that personalized nu-
trition programs may be effective in motivating people to consume a diet that meets indi-
vidual needs while moving them closer to public health recommendations overall. as 
such, personalized nutrition programs seem to have added value as compared to general

programs seem to have added value as compared to general guidelines or one-size-fits-allnutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 19 of 28
approaches. therefore, personalized offerings could be an interesting strategy in improving
adherence with general dietary guidelines, by using general dietary guidelines as the basis
for personalized nutrition and further finetuning these recommendations to individual
needs and preferences.
besides improvements in dietary intake behavior, the intervention resulted in in-
creased physical activity in the pp population. additionally, a small decrease in resting
heart rate was apparent, which could indicate improved physical fitness [ 72–74]. however,
it is unclear whether a small reduction in 1.3 bpm resting heart rate is clinically meaningful.
the improvement in physical activity is an interesting finding, as the intervention consisted
of dietary advice only and participants did not receive any recommendations on their
physical exercise. this increase in physical activity thus seems to be a beneficial side-effect
of being involved in the psn program.
the improvements in dietary intake and physical activity are supported by improve-
ments in health parameters during the intervention, including body fat, bmi, body weight,
hip circumference and total and ldl cholesterol. the reduction in body fat, bmi, body
weight and hip circumference are relatively small and may not be clinically meaningful. a
3 to 5% of weight loss can be considered clinically meaningful, while in our study weight
loss was ~1% [ 75]. however, this was achieved with a normal diet that did not focus
on weight loss. these declines may become clinically meaningful if they persist with a
continued healthy eating pattern. the reduction in bmi, body fat and hip circumference in
the pp population during the intervention period can be explained by the reduced calorie
intake and increased step count, suggesting a negative overall energy balance [76–78].
when looking at differences between the two pdts, the degree of weight loss was more
consistent for group g ( p< 0.0001) as compared to group a ( p< 0.01). at baseline, group g
already had a significantly higher bmi as compared to group a, potentially leaving more
room for improvement. however, body weight was not significantly different between
groups. one could argue that the more consistent weight reduction in group g could be
a result of higher protein intake, which has been shown to aide in weight loss [ 79–82],
possibly as a result of improved satiety, appetite and diet-induced thermogenesis [ 83,84].
this was also reflected in the increased satiety response during the intervention, although
this change was seen for the pp population and was not specific for group g.
the decreased total and ldl cholesterol for group g may be partly explained by the
reduced total and saturated fat intake during the intervention, as it has previously been
shown that a higher saturated fat intake is correlated to higher total and ldl cholesterol
levels [ 85–87]. however, the decrease in saturated fat intake during the intervention was
similar for group a and g. additionally, this decrease in total and ldl cholesterol in group
g cannot be ascribed to baseline between-group differences and is likely a result of the psn
program. it has been proposed by the international society of nutrigenetics/nutrigenomics
(isnn) that personalized advice should be more effective in preventing chronic disease than
population-based dietary guidelines [ 88]. this study indeed suggests that personalized
advice may be important to achieve desired health and functional outcomes. additionally,
the differential effects between subgroups indicate the added value of personalization. this
suggests that personalized nutrition may enable changes in dietary intakes that have not
occurred through public health recommendations. previous research comparing dna-
based dietary guidelines with population-based dietary guidelines indeed showed greater
changes in the intake of specific dietary components in the personalized group [ 89,90]. this
could be explained by the fact that dietary guidelines only distinguish recommendations
based on gender and age, whilst personalized nutrition can use more specific and detailed
personal information in generating relevant dietary advice. while more research is needed
to see if these changes can be sustained over time, the results suggest that personalized
approaches to health may be more effective than general guidelines and mass media
campaigns for achieving dietary goals. in addition to providing a means to improve health,
it also provides a means to work more closely with regulators. moving from population-
based programs to personalized recommendations and claims is new to many regulators.nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 20 of 28
personalized approaches can align to and support adherence to population-based guidance,
which may help personalized programs gain greater acceptance [13,91].
despite the differences in individual measures of health, no overall health effect could
be observed using the health space score. furthermore, there were no significant differences
in health space scores between group a and g. this may be ascribed to the small number
of participants with sufficient data for health space analysis ( n= 46), whilst the power
calculation indicated that data for 100 participants were required to detect a significant
change. additionally, the intervention period was only 10 weeks, which is relatively short
to achieve significant changes in the total set of biomarkers. as there were substantial
improvements in dietary intake and markers of health status, it could be expected that
changes in health space may have been observed with a longer intervention. furthermore,
the largest subgroup in the study consisted of group a ( n= 48), representing subjects who
were most phenotypically flexible. for this pdt, there may have been less opportunity for
health improvement based on the markers used, as opposed to the smaller group g ( n= 22),
which forms the least flexible pdt. despite this limitation, we were still able to show an
overall improvement in dietary behavior in our study as well as on single health outcomes.
our findings are consistent with previous studies on personalized nutrition programs,
which also show benefits of personalized advice as compared to a control group [ 9,92].
previous reports have suggested that it is unclear whether personalization based on phe-
notype or genotype has additional value as compared to only using dietary intake for
personalization [ 93,94]. a recent systematic review on the effect of incorporating genetic
testing results into nutrition counseling on dietary intake concludes that disclosure of
genetic information in carriers of high-risk gene variants may produce benefits, but results
should be interpreted with caution due to the limited number of studies and large hetero-
geneity [ 95]. in the present study, phenotype and genotype, and not dietary intake data,
were used to create pdts. however, the included snps only played a minor role in the
personalized advice, and thus probably had a limited effect on the study results. our results
mainly demonstrate that biological markers can be effectively used for personalization of
advice leading to improvements in diet quality and health status. for example, we found
improved total and ldl cholesterol and more consistent weight loss in the subgroup with
a reduced health status. this beneficial effect might not have occurred if the personalized
advice would have been based on dietary intake information only. a recent consensus
report from the academy of nutrition and dietetics also states that personalized nutrition
requires a holistic approach that reflects lifestyle, preferences, health status and other
domains of nutrition care [96,97].
it has been recognized previously that not only the information used for personal-
ization of advice is of importance, but personal goals, barriers and preferences are also
essential in the adoption of lifestyle changes [ 98]. the incorporation of these factors in
our study, and thereby taking a holistic approach to personalized nutrition, may partially
explain the intervention success. surprisingly, an individual’s perceived health and quality
of life also seems to influence intervention success. in this study, a higher self-reported
physical health score at baseline was associated with a higher number of steps after the
intervention. additionally, a higher perceived health was associated with a larger change
in steps during the intervention period. this suggests an association between steps or phys-
ical activity and health satisfaction. it has been previously reported that a lower perceived
physical and psychological health can form barriers for lifestyle behavior change [99,100].
in other words, people with a lower self-reported quality of life may experience more
barriers for lifestyle behavior change, which may result in a lower effectiveness of lifestyle
interventions. it has been shown that behavioral treatment strategies, including goal
setting and motivational interviewing, improve adherence to lifestyle intervention pro-
grams [ 16,101]. the incorporation of such strategies in our personalized nutrition program
may explain the high (82%) compliance rates with the personalized meals in this study.
the results underscore the importance of providing both personalized dietary recommen-nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 21 of 28
dations based on an individual’s biological data as well as tailoring behavior advice to
achieve better compliance.
investigating the sustainability of intervention adherence and the beneficial effects of
our psn program over time would require long-term follow up of participants. however, it
has been shown previously that challenge testing is a highly sensitive approach in detecting
subtle changes in health [ 35,37], which could allow for fine-tuning the personalized advice
to changes in health status over time. in the future, it could be interesting to consider
ann-of-1 approach, which focuses on changes over time within an individual and could
therefore help identifying differences in effectiveness of personalized programs between
subjects and subgroups on a more detailed level.
4.1. limitations
there were some limitations to this study that should be considered. first, by de-
sign, the distribution of participants over the subgroups could not be influenced, as the
automated psn algorithms assigned participants into one of seven pdts after enrollment.
unfortunately, this resulted in an unequal distribution, with only two out of seven pdts
frequently occurring.
second, self-measurements were used for generating the personalized dietary advice.
during the onboarding process, participants self-measured their body weight, height,
and waist circumference and reported on hypertension status (yes or no). when using
waist circumference and blood pressure data as assessed by the study team during the
baseline visit instead of the self-reported data for assigning the pdt, 22 participants in
group a should have been classified as group e. most misclassifications occurred because
hypertension was not reported by hypertensive participants, even though some of these
participants were aware of their hypertension. if objective measurements would have been
used, and participants would have been categorized accordingly; being confronted with
their compromised health status may have motivated them to change their behavior to a
larger extent. accurate classification of the 22 participants to group e may therefore have
resulted in larger differences between the subgroups. this underscores that caution should
be exercised when using self-reported data for personalized services. misreporting may
in general have consequences for the success of personalized nutrition programs, if these
programs rely on self-reported data. in addition, an inherent limitation to the use of the
bioelectrical impedance is hydration status, which may ultimately result in the misesti-
mation of fat and fat-free body mass. this misestimation may be more prevalent in obese
individuals due to differences in body water, relative to normal weight individuals [ 102].
we did attempt to minimize these limitations in our design where participants served as
their own control, by guiding participants on the importance of consistent hydration, in the
use of consistent equipment and similar timing of visits. finally, although well-described
and standardized, the procedure used for collecting dietary intake data was not internally
validated. another limitation in this study was the lack of a control arm in this study. as
this study was conducted in a workforce setting, a naïve control was not possible due to
the inability to blind participants to the intervention. however, a 10-week run-in period
was part of this study, which provides an indication of behavior changes and health effects
of being included in a clinical study and could therefore be used as a qualitative control.
during this run-in period, insulin resistance parameters increased, suggesting a reduced
health state during the run-in period. the health improvements during the intervention
period can therefore be ascribed to the psn program and are not merely the result of being
involved in a clinical trial. in a follow-up study, the effects of the psn program should be
compared to a control group receiving general advice.
last, the intervention took place in a workforce. previous studies have shown that
sorting beneficial health effects in a workforce is challenging, which includes issues such
as fit with organizational values, work climate, (perceived) management support, low
participation rates and restructuring [ 103–106]. this workforce setting may also explain the
drop-out rate in this study, as other workplace prevention programs show high attritionnutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 22 of 28
rates of 30 to 50%, whilst more intensive participation in workforce programs has been
correlated with a greater reduction in health risks [107–109].
4.2. strengths
first, despite the challenges related to performing a study in a workforce setting, this
setting is also a strength of this study. as the workforce setting is a potential implementation
area for personalized nutrition programs, performing a study in such a setting provides
a good indication of its effectiveness in real life. even in this real-life situation, beneficial
effects of a personalized nutrition program were found.
second, the onboarding for this personalized nutrition program was also designed
such that it was completely do-it-yourself and thus could be performed in an at-work or
at-home setting. for blood collection, dbs cards were used and required only a few blood
drops that were easily collected by finger pricks. blood spot collection was completed
unsupervised. the type of card used allowed for multiple samples to be collected from each
card to help correct for under-sampling on a given card. despite some of the limitations
discussed above, this report demonstrates that a do-it-yourself personalized nutrition
program can improve diet and markers of health status.
third, the personalized nutrition program combined an online platform with feed-
back, advice, and contact with an rdn, which augmented the experience for participants.
additionally, previous research has shown that combining e-health with personal contact
is more effective in realizing lifestyle behavior change [22,23].
fourth, in this study, a mixed-meal challenge test was part of the baseline assessment
and used as the basis for the personalized nutrition program. as this challenge test
simulates consumption of a real meal and allows data capture on the postprandial state, it
provides a more holistic view of the metabolic health status of an individual as compared
to fasting measurements only [ 35,110]. a recent study by berry et al. also showed the
importance of postprandial measurements and the differences in postprandial glucose and
lipid response to food between individuals .
fifth, participants were offered personalized meals on weekdays for breakfast and
lunch, whilst most personalized nutrition studies only offer recommendations and not the
actual foods. this makes it easy to adhere to the personalized nutrition recommendations,
at least during breakfast and lunch.
last, the focus in this study was on the quality of the provided meals (ingredients,
macronutrient quality, micronutrient content) and not the quantity of meals. the caloric
content of meals was equal for all participants. therefore, the results from this study
showed the added value of a high-quality diet and not merely the effects of caloric restric-
tion. calorie intake did decrease during the intervention, but this was likely the result of
the higher satiating properties of the healthy personalized foods.
5. conclusions
in our study, we have shown that a psn program on a workforce has positive effects
on health behavior, body composition and markers of health status for groups a and g
(as other groups were underrepresented in the study), thus showing that psn programs
can improve health outcomes. our study suggests that personalized nutrition may enable
changes in dietary intakes that have not occurred through public health recommendations,
for example, the recommendation to reduce sodium intake by 20% [ 112]. additionally,
between-group differences indicate that personalized dietary programs may be an effective
approach in realizing targeted behavior change in specific health-compromised individuals
or target groups. considering these two aspects, the possibility exists that in the future,
personalized nutrition may provide the tools and motivation to enable individuals to
achieve recommendations and reduce the health and economic burden of chronic diseases.nutrients 2021 ,13, 1763 23 of 28
