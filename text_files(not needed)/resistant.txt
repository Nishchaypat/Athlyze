however, there is still a lack of consensus regarding the eciency of advanced rt techniques and methods in comparison to traditional approaches. methods: medline and sportdiscus databases were searched from 1996 to september 2019 for all studies investigating the eects of advanced rt techniques and methods on muscle hypertrophy and training variables. thirty articles met the inclusion criteria and were consequently included for the quality assessment and data extraction.
results: concerning the time-eciency of training, the use of agonistantagonist, upperlower body supersets, drop and cluster sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, employment of fast, but controlled duration of eccentric contractions 2s, and high-load rt supplemented with low-load rt under blood ow restriction may provide an additional stimulus and an advantage to traditional training protocols.
with regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of accentuated eccentric loading in rt should be considered. implementation of drop sets, sarcoplasma stimulating training, low-load rt in conjunction with low-load rt under blood ow restriction could provide time-ecient solutions to increased metabolic stress.
conclusions: due to insucient evidence, it is dicult to provide specic guidelines for volume, intensity of eort, and frequency of previously mentioned rt techniques and methods. however, well-trained athletes may integrate advanced rt techniques and methods into their routines as an additional stimulus to break through plateaus and to prevent training monotony.
keywords: muscle growth; drop sets; supersets; accentuated eccentric work; blood ow restriction; pre-exhaustion; sarcoplasma stimulating training; movement tempo 1. introduction resistance training rt is a primary exercise intervention used to develop strength and stimulate muscle hypertrophy. increases in muscle mass constitute key components of conditioning in various sports due to the correlation between muscle cross-sectional area and muscle strength 1,2.
additionally, an increase in muscle mass is one of the goals of bodybuilding 3, and many recreationally strength-trained individuals.
furthermore, adequate levels of muscle mass are an important issue from a health standpoint because its low levels are associated with increased risks of several diseases such as cardiovascular disease 4 and cardio-metabolic risk in adolescents 5 as well as type ii diabetes in middle aged and older adults 6. muscle hypertrophy occurs when muscle protein synthesis exceeds muscle protein breakdown and results in positive net protein balance in cumulative periods 7. this could be achieved with int.

with regard to rt, manipulation of its variables such as intensity and volume of eort, exercise order, number of performed repetitions and sets, tempo of movement, and the duration of rest periods between sets and exercises and training status have been extensively explored and discussed to maximize muscle adaptations 9,10. volume and intensity of eort are basic components with a direct impact on muscular adaptations 11,12.
the american college of sports medicine acsm recommends 13 sets per exercise of 812 repetitions with 7085 of one repetition maximum 1rm for novice and 36 sets of 112 repetitions with 70100 1rm for advanced individuals 13. however, the recent literature shows a much wider range of training options. several studies have found that training with low-loads 3060 1rm results in similar hypertrophy to training with moderate and high-loads 60 1rm when volitional fatigue occurs 11,1416.
moreover, reaching volitional fatigue at all times is not necessary to make signicant gains in hypertrophy 17, especially when training with high-loads is considered 18. evidence indicates that signicant muscle growth occurs when the majority of training sets are performed with 34 repetitions in reserve with moderate to high-loads 19.
furthermore, it has been established that the volume of rt, dened as the total number of repetitions repetitions x sets, together with loads used for a given exercise, is the key element of adaptation in terms of muscle hypertrophy; moreover, it has been suggested that higher volumes of eort are warranted for maximizing muscle growth response in diverse populations 12,2023.
however, following years of training, it becomes dicult to induce further muscle hypertrophy 24, therefore individuals seek advanced resistance training techniques. the purpose of the present paper was to provide an objective and critical review related to advanced rt methods and techniques inuencing skeletal muscle, which may contribute to maximizing muscle hypertrophy in both recreational and competitive athletes. 2. methods 2.1.

training considerations three major factors are emphasized in the conventional hypertrophy model: mechanical tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage 55. these factors can occur by optimal manipulation of rt variables and through a wide range of rt techniques. progressive mechanical tension overload is considered one of the major factors of muscle growth and changes in muscle architecture, which are attained by increasing rt intensity of eort.
rt with high-loads 85 1rm, and a low number of repetitions 15 as well as long rest intervals 35 min is largely oriented toward a greater magnitude of mechanical tension, which primarily develops strength, while muscle hypertrophy is compromised 13. rt with a lower number of repetitions, yet with high-loads emphasizes mechanical tension and results in high levels of neural recruitment fast-twitch muscle bers.
another critical variable inuencing hypertrophy with an evidenced dose-response relationship is rt volume 11,56. higher rt volume 2830 setsmuscleweek is associated with greater increases in hypertrophy compared to lower volume 610 setsmuscleweek in both untrained and trained populations 12,20.
implementation of training with moderate number of repetitions 612, multiple sets 36, moderate loads 6080 1rm, and short rest intervals 60 s between sets elicits greater metabolic stress in contrast with high-loads, which appears to be a potent stimulus for inducing muscle hypertrophy 57. however, as long as rt is performed to volitional fatigue, training load might not aect exercise-induced muscle growth.
findings by schoenfeld et al. 11 indicate that both low-load rt 60 1rm performed to volitional fatigue and moderate-load rt 60 1rm elicit signicant increases in muscle hypertrophy among well-trained young men. however, the participants following the low-load rt protocol performed approximately three times the total training volume compared to the high-load group sets repetitions.
similar ndings were also demonstrated in a study by ikezoe et al. 58, which highlighted the importance of performing exercise to volitional fatigue when low-loads were used to maximize muscle hypertrophy outcomes. these authors compared increments in muscle thickness rectus femoris after eight weeks of training with low-load, higher volume 30 1rm, 12 sets x 8 repetitions to training with high-load, lower volume 80 1rm, 3 sets x 8 repetitions leg extensions in young men.
considering that the training volume in the high-load group was signicantly lower than that in the low-load, the degree of muscle thickness attained after intervention was almost twice as high in the high-load group 58. however, it should be noted that if rt is not conducted to volitional fatigue, reaching the minimum rt intensity threshold 601rm is necessary to maximize muscle hypertrophy 59.
furthermore, implementation of advanced rt techniques could provide an additional stimulus to break through plateaus for trained subjects 24 and prevent excessive monotony in training. the most recent rt techniques and methods frequently used by practitioners and coaches include accentuated eccentric loading, prolonged eccentric tempo, cluster sets, high-load rt combined with low-load rt under blood ow restriction, supersets, drop sets, pre-exhaustion, and sarcoplasma stimulating training.
3.2. tempo eccentric technique one of the advanced rt techniques is based on a prolonged duration of the eccentric phase of the movement. the duration of each repetition can be identied by movement tempo, which is determined by four digits e.g., 2010 corresponding to the duration in seconds of particular phases of movement eccentric, transition, concentric, transition 30.
changes in the movement tempo during rt impacts the maximal number of repetitions performed in a set, the maximal time under tension, and the nal exercise volume 2527. several studies have indicated that the use of a faster movement tempo e.g., 2020 results in a signicant increase in the maximal number of performed repetitions when compared to the slower tempo e.g., 6020 2527.
in contrast, a slower tempo of movement, especially during the eccentric phase e.g., 6020, decreases the number of performed repetitions, but int. j. environ. res. public health 2019, 16, 4897 7 of 14 extends the time under tension, which may contribute to greater muscle hypertrophy 28.
on the other hand, a meta-analysis of schoenfeld et al. 60 indicates that similar hypertrophic responses occur when the duration of repetitions ranges from 0.5 to 8 s, although it must be noted that they 60 did not control the duration of particular phases of movement eccentric vs. concentric, thus making it dicult to draw denite conclusions.
furthermore, a study by shibata et al. 29 showed that the dominant leg thigh cross-sectional area increased in a similar manner following both the slow 4 s and the fast 2 s eccentric phase during the back squat exercise performed to volitional fatigue in a group of male soccer players.
in light of the greater force capacity of eccentric actions, and the fact that the energy requirements are typically 4-fold smaller than during the concentric contraction of the same load 61, it would seem logical that lower metabolic stress may occur, which could limit the responses to this training technique.
however, studies indicate a wide range of manipulation of the duration of the eccentric phase of movement can be employed if the primary goal of training is to maximize muscle hypertrophy 29,60. although, it is not currently clear whether slow tempo provides a superior stimulus for muscle hypertrophy, from a practical point of view, employing a fast but controlled duration of the eccentric phase 2s may allow for a high time-eciency of training and prevent the excessive time of training sessions.
3.3. accentuated eccentric loading method another useful method that can be used during rt, based on eccentric contractions includes accentuated eccentric loading ael. this training strategy is based on the muscles ability to generate greater force during maximal eccentric 2060 versus other types of contraction. the use of weight releasers allow for overloading the muscles during the eccentric phase of movement due to its specic construction.
the weight can be unloaded in the transition from the eccentric to the concentric phase of movement. the use of high-loads during the eccentric phase of movement is associated with signicant exercise induced muscle damage and mechanical tension, which have been associated with a hypertrophic response 55. furthermore, some studies have shown that performing eccentric-only contractions led to higher gains in muscle mass when compared to concentric-only actions 30,62.
nonetheless, recent literature has indicated that when the volume of training was matched, both ael and high-load rt led to similar hypertrophic responses in groups of strength-trained athletes 31,32,63. furthermore, rt protocols that did not promote signicant muscle damage still induced similar muscle hypertrophy in comparison with those protocols that promoted initial muscle damage 7. however, dierences appear in muscle architecture adaptations.
training with the concentric-only phase led to muscle growth mainly by the addition of sarcomeres in parallel increased pennation angle with little change in fascicle length, while training with eccentric-only contractions led by the addition of sarcomeres in series increased fascicle length and a small increase in the pennation angle 64. furthermore, due to the greater mechanical tension, it could provide an additional hypertrophic stimulus 31,33,65.
although it must be noted that the main disadvantage of this technique is the necessity of weight releasers or the presence of experienced spotters during training. moreover ael, requires the eccentric load to reload after every repetition, thus is possible that the inter-repetition rest may excessively extend the time of particular repetitions and the whole training session.
3.4. low-load resistance training under blood flow restriction another rt method that allows for the avoidance of high mechanical stress associated with high-load rt and the high training volumes required when exercising with low-loads to volitional fatigue is to combine rt under blood ow restriction bfr 34,66,67.
the bfr method involves the application of a restrictive device a tourniquet, an inatable cu, or elastic wraps on the proximal part of the limb to reduce the arterial blood ow and to occlude the venous return 67. such an intervention results in an accumulation of metabolic products distal to the restriction and when coupled with rt, drastically increases metabolic stress. however, with regard to low-load rt under bfr, a int. j. environ. res.
public health 2019, 16, 4897 8 of 14 signicant increase in the muscle cross-sectional area was observed even without reaching volitional fatigue in particular sets 35. furthermore, several studies have suggested that increases in muscle mass following low-load rt under bfr 2030 1rm do not exceed those observed after the use of high-load rt 80 1rm without bfr 3638.
the eectiveness of using bfr concerns various populations such as non-athletes 39,40, moderately experienced participants 1 year 36, and elite athletes 41,42. high-load rt with additional low-load sets under bfr may elicit benecial muscular responses in healthy athletes 68.
the most frequently and evidence-based repetition and set scheme involves 30 repetitions in the rst set followed by three sets of 15 repetitions with 30 s rests in between with 2040 1rm and pressure, which contribute to 4080 of arterial occlusion pressure 69. however, it must be noted that bfr induced muscle growth is limited to the limb muscles 43.
3.5. cluster sets technique another rt technique that partly allows for the balance of both mechanical tension and metabolic stress consists of cluster sets. in a traditional scheme of sets, repetitions, a chosen group of exercises are performed consecutively, with a long inter-set rest interval, are then followed by another set of repetitions. on the contrary, cluster sets include short, inter-set rest intervals 2060s with a lower number of repetitions 70.
previous research has mostly investigated the eects of cluster sets on force production, power output, and movement velocity, while ndings related to muscle hypertrophy are limited 44. nevertheless, implementation of inter-set rest intervals allows for a greater rt volume to be achieved for a particular external load when compared with a traditional scheme of sets 44,45 in trained and untrained men, possibly providing an additional stimulus for muscle hypertrophy.
however, it should be noted that cluster sets induce less metabolic stress, but greater emphasis is placed on mechanical stress due to the use of higher training intensities of eort in comparison with traditional sets 4446,71. thus, the implementation of cluster sets with short inter-set rest intervals could be a useful strategy to carry out high-volume sessions of high-loads, while keeping a high time-eciency of training training volumetime.
furthermore, cluster sets may serve as an alternative to traditional sets for promoting muscle hypertrophy over time during parallel periodization models 46, and prevent monotony in training. moreover, future studies should investigate the direct eects of cluster sets on exercise-induced muscle growth. 3.6. supersets and pre-exhaustion technique supersets and pre-exhaustion during rt can be dened as a pair of dierent exercise sets performed without rest.
supersets most commonly consist of two exercises for the same muscle group 47, agonist-antagonist muscles 48,72 or alternating upper and lower body muscle groups 49 consecutively followed by a recovery period; pre-exhaustion involves performing a single-joint before a multi-joint exercise for the same muscle group e.g., dumbbell y before the bench press.
in a study by wallace et al. 47, supersets at bench press followed by the incline bench press resulted in a signicantly lower volume of training than a traditional exercise order in strength-trained males. however, with regard to agonistantagonist supersets, investigation by robbins et al. 48 bench pull paired with the bench press indicated a signicantly higher training volume when compared to a traditional exercise order.
furthermore, this type of superset as well as upperlower body supersets were found to be more time-ecient than traditional exercise order sessions 48,49. the pre-exhaustion technique is commonly used by bodybuilders seeking to enhance the muscle growth of target muscles.
the rationale for this technique is that performing a single-joint exercise rst fatigues the agonist in isolation, thereby placing greater stress on the agonist and increasing its activation during multi-joint exercise and potentiating its hypertrophy 73.
another variation is the reverse pre-exhaustion e.g., triceps pushdown before the bench press, and the justication for this approach is that the fatigued synergist contributes less to the subsequent multi-joint exercise, thereby placing greater stress on the agonist group 74. however, a study by golas et al. 75 partially int. j. environ. res.
public health 2019, 16, 4897 9 of 14 disagreed with this statement as the results indicated that a pre-exhaustion exercise incline dumbbell y did not aect the pectoralis major activity during the at bench press exercise at 95 1rm. despite that, pre-exhaustion of the synergist muscles triceps brachii and anterior deltoid before the bench press led to their higher activation during the multi-joint movement bench press as compared to the baseline 75.
furthermore, results of a study by soares et al. 50 suggested that pre-exhaustion triceps pushdown followed by the bench press decreased the maximal number of repetitions performed during a set to volitional fatigue. in conclusion, practitioners aiming to maximize training volume and intensity of eort may be well advised to consider the use of supersets agonistantagonist and upperlower body in their rt programs.
the use of these exercise orders may be more time-ecient than the traditional approach, and especially useful when time limitations exist in the planning of training sessions. 3.7. drop sets and sarcoplasma stimulating training technique drop sets involve performing a set to volitional fatigue with a given load and then immediately reducing the load e.g., 20 and continuing the exercise until subsequent volitional fatigue 76.
briey, the rationale for this technique is high metabolic stress induced due to a high number of repetitions performed with short rest intervals. accordingly, a study by fink et al. 51 showed signicantly higher muscle thickness after drop sets in comparison with rt following a traditional sets scheme, which can be considered as a potential marker for metabolic stress 57.
furthermore, results of the study by fink et al. 51 showed signicant increases in the triceps cross-sectional area after six weeks of drop sets training when compared to traditional sets. nevertheless, it must be noted that participants taking part in this research were recreational trained persons with little experience in rt did not regularly train for more than one year.
on the other hand, angleri et al. 52 demonstrated that drop sets did not promote greater lower body muscle growth when compared with traditional sets in well-trained males when training volume was equalized. similarly to drop sets, sarcoplasm stimulating training sst consists of sets of exercises performed at 7080 1rm to volitional fatigue and then repeating this protocol twice more with 20 s rest intervals in between.
the next step is to reduce the external load by 20 and perform an additional set with a 4010 tempo; following a 20 s rest interval, 20 of the external load is reduced again, and a set with 4010 tempo is completed to volitional fatigue. in the last set, the load is further decreased by 20 and after its completion, following a 20 s rest interval, a static hold is performed e.g., at 90of elbow exion to volitional fatigue 53.
another sst variation refers to the performance of eight sets of exercises at 7080 1rm to volitional fatigue with programmed rest intervals between subsequent sets 45, 30, 15, 5, 5, 15, 30, and 45 s without reducing the load 53. similarly, to drop sets, the main aim of sst is to induce high metabolic stress 53.
recently, de almeida et al. 53 demonstrated that sst resulted in greater acute biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscle thickness when compared to a traditional set scheme in trained subjects, even when total training volume was higher in a traditional set scheme rt. evidence suggests the benecial eects of both drop sets and sst in acute increases in triceps brachii muscle thickness 53 in both amateur and well-trained subjects, even with lower training volume versus a traditional set scheme rt.
however, studies that have investigated the chronic eects of drop sets did not show a superior hypertrophy response when compared with traditional sets 52,54. moreover, the chronic eects of sst on muscle growth have not been examined yet. 3.8. limitations the present review has several limitations that should be addressed. the majority of included studies did not control nutritional intake, which can aect the magnitude of muscle adaptations.
another limitation relates to studies that examined the inuence of advanced methods and techniques on training variables, but did not analyze hypertrophic responses andor strength improvements, int. j. environ. res. public health 2019, 16, 4897 10 of 14 which would be the basis for explaining their eciency. in addition, only one study 44 directly compared the responses between trained and untrained participants.
4. conclusions considering the aforementioned studies, eective hypertrophy-oriented training should comprise a combination of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. in summary, foundations for individuals seeking to maximize muscle growth should be hypertrophy-oriented rt consisting of multiple sets 36 of six to 12 repetitions with short rest intervals 60 s and moderate intensity of eort 6080 1rm with subsequent increases in training volume 1228 setsmuscleweek 20.
moreover, trained athletes may consider integrating advanced resistance training techniques and methods to provide an additional stimulus to break through plateaus, prevent monotony, and reduce the time of training sessions. evidence suggests some benecial eects for selected rt techniques especially in the case of training volume, time-eciency, and intensity of eort.
furthermore, even though most of these techniques and methods did not show a superior hypertrophy response compared to the traditional approach, it may serve as an alternative to prevent monotony or it could improve readiness to training sessions. to maintain high time-eciency of training and when time limitations exist, the use of agonistantagonist, upperlower body supersets, drop sets, sst, and cluster sets may provide an advantage to the traditional approach.
furthermore, the employment of fast but controlled tempo 2 s and supplementation of high-load rt with low-load rt under bfr may allow for high time-eciency of training and prevent excessively long training sessions. with regard to the higher degree of mechanical tension, the use of ael in rt should be considered, therefore, in cases where time is limited, cluster sets might be a better choice.
the implementation of drop sets, sst, and low-load rt under bfr could provide time-ecient techniques to increase metabolic stress. in summary, currently there is not sucient evidence to provide specic guidelines for volume, intensity of eort, and frequency of the previously mentioned resistance training techniques. furthermore, persistence in training and diet is essential.
recently, research has shown that muscle hypertrophy that occurs at initial stages of rt 4 sessions is mostly attributable to muscle damage induced cell swelling with the majority of strength gains resulting from neural adaptations 812 sessions. within the latter phase of rt 610 weeks, muscle growth begins to become the dominant factor 7. author contributions: study concept and design: m.k. and g.w.; acquisition of data: m.k. and g.w.; analysis and interpretation of data:

resistance training load effects on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain: systematic review and net- work meta-analysis. med. sci. sports exerc., vol. 53, no. 6, pp. 12061216, 2021.
purpose: this study aimed to analyze the effect of resis- tance training rt performed until volitional failure with low, moderate, and high loads on muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength in healthy adults and to assess the possible participant-, design-, and training-related covariates that may affect the adaptations. methods: using pre- ferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines, medline, cinahl, embase, sportdiscus, and web of science databases were searched.
including only studies that performed sets to volitional failure, the effects of low- 15 repetitions max- imum rm, moderate- 915 rm, and high-load 8 rm rts were examined in healthy adults. network meta-analysis was undertaken to calculate the standardized mean difference smd between rt loads in overall and subgroup analyses involving studies deemed of high qual- ity.
associations between participant-, design-, and training-related covariates with smd were assessed by univariate and multivariate net- work meta-regression analyses. results: twenty-eight studies involving 747 healthy adults were included.
although no differences in muscle hypertrophy between rt loads were found in overall p 0.1130.469 or subgroup analysis p 0.8710.995, greater effects were observed in untrained participants p 0.033 and participants with some training background who undertook more rt sessions p 0.0310.045.
muscle strength improvement was superior for both high-load and moderate-load compared with low-load rt in overall and subgroup analysis smd, 0.600.63 and 0.340.35, respectively; p 0.0010.003, with a nonsignificant but superior effect for high compared with moderate load smd, 0.260.28, p 0.068. conclusions: although muscle hypertrophy improvements seem to be load in- dependent, increases in muscle strength are superior in high-load rt programs.
untrained participants exhibit greater muscle hypertrophy, whereas undertaking more rt sessions provides superior gains in those with previous training experience. key words: strength training, volitional failure, muscle hypertrophy, muscle strength r esistance training is a popular and effective modality to improve muscle function, functional performance, and health parameters in a wide range of healthy and clinical populations.
among the many expected outcomes, in- creases in muscle size and strength are considered important and desirable by individuals and clinicians either for perfor- mance or health and functional improvement. in the 1940s, delorme and watkins 1 proposed undertaking resistance exercise sets until neuromuscular volitional failure to maxi- mize such benefits.
although a vast body of research work in this area has been published 27, issues regarding how to optimize resistance training outcomes remain 8,9. further-
more, controversies regarding how volitional failure is opera- tionalized call into question the implementation of this technique in populations other than strength athletes, as address for correspondence: pedro lopez, m.sc., exercise medicine research institute, edith cowan university, 270 joondalup drive, joondalup, wa 6027, australia; e-mail: p.lopezdaour.ecu.edu.au. submitted for publication august 2020. accepted for publication december 2020.

doi: 10.1249mss.0000000000002585 1206 applied sciences participants motivation and tolerance, discomfort, and neuro- muscular fatigue affect the performance and results related to this training program. load selection has been considered an important resistance training variable to successfully increase muscle size and strength across different populations 10.
considering hennemans size principle i.e., motor units are recruited from smallest to largest 11, studies have advocated in favor of either high loads 1215 or both low and high loads 16 to achieve maximal or near-maximal recruitment of motor units during fatiguing contractions to induce muscle hypertrophy.
although this is a topic of intense debate in the literature, when low-load sets are performed until volitional failure, neuromuscular fatigue necessitates increasing percentage recruitment of the motor unit pool, and through this mechanism 12, such training may produce a meaningful drive for muscle hypertrophy.
for example, mitchell et al. 6 and lim et al. 5 have re- ported that 10 wk of resistance training until volitional failure in untrained men at low and high loads 30 and 80 of 1 repetition maximum 1-rm resulted in similar increases in quadriceps femoris muscle volume 6.8 and 7.2, respec- tively and muscle fiber cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis ranging from 15 to 20 in both groups.
these findings indicate that muscle hypertrophy may be more respon- sive in untrained individuals because of the large window for adaptation, masking differential effects of training modalities and dosages 17, and not show an obvious load-dependent re- lationship when resistance training sets are performed until vo- litional failure 6,18.
in contrast, schoenfeld and colleagues 7 reported that 8 wk of resistance training at high loads 24 rm induced greater strength gains in recreationally trained men compared with moderate loads 812 rm, whereas increases in elbow extensor and quadriceps femoris muscle thickness were higher for the moderate-load group. consequently, it is unclear as to loading effects on muscle hypertrophy when resis- tance training is undertaken until volitional failure. further-
more, despite previous meta-analyses examining low 60 of 1-rm and higher resistance training load 60 of 1-rm effects on muscle strength and hypertrophy 9,19, the lack of meta-analyses comprising a large number of studies comparing well-defined ranges of load such as low- 60 of 1-rm, moderate- between 60 and 79 of 1-rm, and high-load re- sistance training 80 of 1-rm through robust meta-analytic approaches such as network meta-analysis precludes the deter- mination of an appropriate load for outcomes of interest in healthy adults with different pretraining genetic and morpho- logical characteristics.
other issues comparing resistance training loads are related to the heterogeneity of study designs such as the participants involved men vs women or combined, training status untrained vs recreationally trained vs strength athletes, experimental de- sign between- and within-subject, assessed outcomes lower-, upper-, and whole-body, and training prescription number of sessions; operational definition of volitional failure and its implementation and verification.
these different characteristics among studies may preclude the accurate evaluation of an optimal resistance training load, considering specific methodo- logical or resistance training prescription characteristics when full and similar recruitment of the motor unit pool is achieved.
as a result, the purposes of the review and analysis are to 1 analyze the effect of resistance training performed until failure with low, moderate, and high loads on muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength in healthy adults and 2 assess the possible participant-, design-, and training-related covariates that may af- fect the hypertrophy and strength gains. methods study selection procedure.
the study was undertaken in accordance with the preferred reporting items for system- atic reviews and meta-analyses statement 20,21, and the method used was based on the minimum criteria established by the cochrane back review group 22. the review in- cluded published data from experimental studies that evalu- ated the effects of low 60 of 1-rm, or 15 rm, moderate between 60 and 79 of 1-rm, or 915 rm, and high 80 of 1-rm, or 8 rm loads in resistance train-
ing performed until volitional failure in healthy adults 23. the primary outcomes of this review were muscle hypertro- phy i.e., defined as a measure of muscle mass or size and muscle strength i.e., defined by 1-rm tests.
studies were ex- cluded when 1 they did not present sufficient information re- garding the comparisons between different loads or pretraining and posttraining values in the resistance training programs; 2 in- terventions were shorter than 6 wk; 3 specific outcomes for this review or sufficient information were not reported e.g., baseline and postintervention assessment, and within- and between-group mean difference; 4 resistance training involving blood flow restriction protocols; and 5 written in a language other than english.
in the search strategy, titles and abstracts were first independently evaluated. when abstracts did not provide suf- ficient information, they were selected for full-text evaluation. eligibility was assessed independently by two authors p. l. and j. l. t., with differences resolved by consensus. the search was conducted up to december 2019 using the following electronic databases: medline, cinahl, embase, sportdiscus, and web of science.
the terms used were as follows: resistance training until failure and muscle hyper- trophy or muscle strength in association with a list of sen- sitive terms to search for experimental studies. in addition, a manual search was performed in the reference lists provided in the selected articles as well as in a previous systematic re- view 9 to detect studies potentially eligible for inclusion.
the search strategy used is shown in the supplemental digital content table s1 see in supplemental digital content 1, lit- erature search strategy, http:links.lww.commssc233. data extraction. the data extraction was performed via a standardized form. information regarding participants, resis- tance training protocols, outcomes, and assessment techniques was collected.
study characteristics, intervention duration, num- ber of sessions, sex, experimental design, training status, assessed outcomes, and resistance training prescription method were resistance training in healthy adults medicine science in sports exercise 1207 applied sciences extracted, along with the main outcomes, whereas outcomes were extracted in their absolute units e.g., kilograms for 1-rm assessments; millimeters or centimeters for muscle thickness.
when graphs were used instead of numerical data, the graphs were measured using a specific tool for data extraction webplotdigitizer, san francisco, ca. assessment of risk of bias. the risk of bias of individ- ual studies was evaluated according to the second version of the cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials rob 2 24, focusing on different aspects of trial design, conduct, and reporting. each assessment using the rob 2 tool is fo- cused on the outcome level.
the six-item instrument used to evaluate each included randomized controlled trial in each out- come of interest is as follows: 1 randomization process, 2 de- viation from intended interventions, 3 missing outcome data, 4 measurement of the outcome, 5 selection of the reported re- sult, and 6 overall analysis.
overall risk of bias was expressed as low risk of bias if all domains where classified as low risk, some concerns if some concern was raised in at least one do- main but not classified as at high risk in any other, or high risk of bias if at least one domain was classified as high risk, or have multiple domains with some concerns 24.
data analysis.in thenetwork meta-analysis, the pooled-effect estimates were obtained from the standardized mean difference smd of baseline to the final assessment of the intervention for each group. when studies did not provide standard deviation sd of change in the outcomes, these values were estimated using a correlation coefficient r of 0.5 and the equation: sdchange sd2 baseline sd2 final2r sdbaseline sdfinal q as per the cochrane handbook guideline 25.
furthermore, to avoid overestimating the weight of a study by entering it mul- tiple times in the analysis 25, experimental groups from the studies were combined when considered within the same resis- tance training load group e.g., three sets of 3040 rm and three sets of 100150 rm defined as low-load resistance train- ing 2, as well as outcomes when considered within the same outcome category e.g., lower-body muscle hypertrophy or upper-body muscle strength.
analyses were conducted for overall studies, and a subgroup analysis was provided for best-quality studies based on the risk of bias assessment.
the network meta-analysis was performed following the cur- rent preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guideline items 26,27: 1 a network geome- try was created to explore the comparisons between resis- tance training loads; 2 transitivity was tested by fitting a network inconsistency assumption along with q test and side-splitting analyses between indirect and direct compari- sons; and 3 effect size es was generated considering the heterogeneity and the inconsistency level in the models.
sta- tistical significance was assumed when the smd reached an value 0.05. according to cohen 28, es values of 0.0 to 0.5 indicate small; 0.51 to 0.79, medium; and 0.8, large ef- fects. furthermore, an estimation of the probability to be the best resistance training program for the outcome was provided based on the consistency values and expressed as a percentage.
outliers were explored by sensitivity analyses omitting one study at a time, generating pooled estimates, and comparing with the original estimates. to check for the presence of publication bias, a network funnel plot and the eggers test were used, with a significant publication bias considered if the p value was 0.1 29. the network meta-analysis was conducted using r r core team, 2019 with the package netmeta 30.
forest plots presented for the outcome measures are after sensitivity analysis adjustments.
to test the association between smd and specific covari- ates such as year of publication, experimental design i.e., between-subject vs within-subject, sex i.e., women vs men, training status i.e., untrained vs recreationally trained, number of sessions, assessed outcomes i.e., lower- vs upper-body out- comes, and the prescription method i.e., 1-rm vs rm, uni- variate and multivariate network meta-regressions were used 31.
dichotomy variables were coded as 0 and 1, whereas continuous variables were used in the model to explain the variations in muscle hypertrophy and strength among all com- parisons. the network meta-regression was conducted using stata 14.0 with the package mvmeta 31. results studies included. all studies selected reported the aim to compare the effect of different resistance training loads i.e., low, moderate, or high on muscle hypertrophy and strength in healthy men and women.
we retrieved 5924 studies, 2629 of which were retained for screening after duplicate removals. of these, 2515 were excluded, and 114 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility fig. 1. the eligibility assessment re- sulted in a total of 28 27,3253 studies included in the pres- ent review, network meta-analyses, and meta-regression, of which 24 studies 37,3240,4253 examined muscle hyper- trophy and 23 studies 27,32,33,35,3848,5052 examined muscle strength.
during the eligibility assessment, one of the authors from the studies of au et al. 54 and morton et al. 43 was contacted for further information, and it was con- firmed that the study of au et al. 54 was a follow-up analysis from morton et al. 43. as a result, only the study of morton et al. 43 was included in the systematic review. participants and intervention characteristics. a total of 747 healthy men and women with an average age of 23.4 3.0 yr participated in the included studies.
seventeen studies compared low- versus high-load resistance training 2,5,6,33,34,36,38,39,4246,4951,53, four compared low- versus moderate-load 35,40,47,52, five compared moderate- versus high-load 7,32,37,41,48, and two studies compared low- versus moderate- versus high-load 3,4.

most of the studies undertook a between-subject experimental design 22 of 28, or 78.6 2,3,5,7,3238,4043,4649,5153 and prescribed the resistance training program by repetitions maxi- mum 18 of 28, or 64.3 2,3,7,32,3537,4043,4649,5153; table s2, supplemental digital content 2, characteristics of included studies, http:links.lww.commssc234.
regarding the assessments, muscle hypertrophy was assessed for the lower limbs in 15 studies 37,32,3539,43,44,49,50, followed by 8 studies assessing the upper limbs 4,7,32, 34,45,47,48,50 and 5 studies assessing the whole body e.g., dual-energy x-ray ab- sorptiometry 33,40,42,46,53, whereas lower-body muscle strength was assessed in 20 studies 37,32,33,35,3844,46, 48,5052, followed by 12 studies assessing upper-body mus- cle strength 2,4,7,33,40,41,43,45,47,48,50,51, all using the 1-rm test.
eighteen studies reported the total volume per- formed during the intervention 4,5,7,3235,3745,48,50. the number of studies among the resistance training loads for muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength is shown in the network geometry fig. 2, panels a and b, respectively. risk of bias assessment. for muscle hypertrophy, 87.5 of the studies have some concern 21 of 24 studies figure 1flowchart of study selection process.

thirty-five comparisons were undertaken on muscle hypertrophy involving 24 studies 37,3240,4253. the re- sults from the consistency network meta-analysis provided no differences in muscle hypertrophy between high- and low- load, moderate- and low-load, or high- and moderate-load re- sistance training p 0.1130.469; table 2 and fig. 3. the heterogeneity was i2 0.
furthermore, no differences between the loads were observed in the subgroup analysis involving the best-quality studies number of comparisons 16, i2 0, p 0.8710.995; table 2. although the results of the consis- tency model indicate that moderate-load 84.5 and high-load resistance training 75.8 are the best load for muscle hypertro- phy in overall and high-quality subgroup analyses, respectively, the es values were unlikely to be considered meaningful small es: range, 0.09 to 0.15.
the inconsistency between direct and indirect comparisons was not significant in the network analysis for all studies q 6.2, p 0.103 or in the subgroup analysis q 0.3, p 0.957, as well as in the node-splitting anal- ysis across comparisons between load groups all studies: p 0.4240.914; best-quality studies: p 0.6150.760. no publication bias was identified after the inspection of funnel plots asymmetry by eggers test p 0.4970.909.

discussion there are three important findings from our systematic re- view and network meta-analysis of the doseresponse rela- tionship between resistance training load and gains in muscle hypertrophy and strength. first, in untrained and recreationally trained individuals i.e., not strength athletes, muscle hyper- trophy gains are likely to be similar regardless of resistance training load when performed to volitional failure over rela- tively short periods of intervention.
in line with the physiolog- ical adaptation principle of diminishing returns, untrained participants exhibit greater muscle hypertrophy compared with those with even modest prior experience in resistance training. furthermore, undertaking more resistance training sessions pro- vides superior muscle size gains in those with previous training experience.
second, effects on muscle strength are load dependent, with higher loads resulting in greater gains over the relatively short interventions reviewed.
finally, the results for muscle hypertrophy and strength were maintained even when only the higher-quality studies were considered, that is, studies with less riskof bias.therefore,althoughimprovementsinmusclehypertro- phy seem to be load independent for untrained and recreationally trained individuals, muscle strength increases are superior with high-load resistance training programs of short duration.
the inclusion of experimental studies using repetitions until volitional failure is based on ensuring that a similar stressful stimulus was undertaken by all participants in the resistance training programs 57.
although performing resistance train- ing until volitional failure is one way to eliminate a large amount of individual variability related to between-subject en- durance capacity i.e., individuals who are able to complete different numbers of repetitions at a given relative load and ensures methodological feasibility when comparing different resistance training loads 57, other approaches have been table 3. network meta-regression models for muscle hypertrophy and muscle strength.

therefore, although exercising until volitional failure is not mandatory for neuromuscular adaptations 58,59, it was the strategy required to compare the efficacy of different resistance training load protocols 57. our findings are that performing as many repetitions as pos- sible per set with different loads over relatively short interven- tions leads to similar muscle hypertrophy in individuals with none or moderate resistance training experience.
it seems that any training load can produce a similar magnitude of muscle hypertrophy for different participants men and women and muscles assessed lower- and upper-body. thus, over relatively short training interventions in untrained or novice subjects, sets to failure are one strategy for gaining muscle hypertrophy, regard- less of the load undertaken in resistance training.
with other strat- egies, albeit beyond the scope of this review, if performed with a load that activates a high percentage of motor units, hypertrophy is likely to occur.
however, it is important to note that the practi- cal application may still favor the use of a lower number of rep- etitions using moderate to high loads as the performance of low loads until volitional failure results in higher discomfort due to the higher number of repetitions, longer time under muscu- lar tension, and time required 60.
as revealed by the meta-regression, muscle hypertrophy de- rived from low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance training regimes, despite the modest and nonsignificant difference between them, seems to be affected by training status and number of sessions completed, that is, volume. untrained participants exhibit a greater magnitude of muscle hypertro- phy compared with those recreationally trained.
as reported in previous literature, trained muscles may already present with an increased cross-sectional area 61 and lower anabolic signaling as observed in reduced ampk and akt phosphory- lation after a resistance training session 62, resulting in an at- tenuated hypertrophic response in participants with previous resistance training experience.
however, our findings also in- dicate greater muscle hypertrophy in recreationally trained participants who undertake a higher number of sessions com- pared with those undertaking less. it seems that participants with longer experience in resistance training range, 27 yr 7,40,41,43,47,48,53, although still not highly trained, require a higher volume of training to produce the same or greater hy- pertrophic adaptation exhibiting the principle of diminishing returns.
thus, although there were no differences between training loads for muscle hypertrophy, the meta-regression re- sults suggest that novice participants are likely to experience su- perior gains than those with previous experience in resistance figure 4smd effects between low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance training performed until volitional failure on muscle strength. overall and sub- group analyses conducted with a network random-effects model.

given the lack of studies with more than 14-wk duration, any interpretation of these results for longer periods should be viewed with caution. in contrast to muscle hypertrophy, muscle strength, as de- fined by 1-rm testing, was found to be dependent on high loads.
this finding is expected following 1 the principle of specificity 13 as participants allocated in higher-load resis- tance training groups trained more closely to the requirement for the 1-rm test and presented greater transfer to this outcome, and 2 a combination of both neural and skeletal muscle adap- tations derived from higher-load resistance training programs resulting in greater effects on muscle strength 38,6365.
moreover, the magnitude of change in low- versus high-load re- sistance training was consistent with that previously reported by schoenfeld et al. 9 and across all load comparisons favoring the highest loads. regarding the difference between moderate- and high-load resistance, this comparison approached statistical significance p 0.072, and the es of 0.3 suggests a possible superior gain with high-load training protocols.
interestingly, within the limitations of the relative paucity of training studies in which women were subjects, in the low- versus high-load comparison, men derived greater muscle strength benefits than women, whereas women improved their strength more than men in comparisons involving moderate-load training.
these results may be related to sex differences in prior experience with resistance training and perceived exertion with resistance training sessions as previously suggested 6668, and possible discrepancies between the prescribed and complied resistance training dosage 35. moreover, the different time- course adaptations between men and women may also account for differential maximal strength gains over prolonged resistance training periods 63,64.
however, we are unable to confirm this because of the short duration of the studies analyzed ranging from 6 to 12 wk, lack of training variables reported in the studies undertaken by women 32,33,3537,4952, and the inability for a more robust narrative concerning studies of longer duration that did not make intensity comparisons in their designs e.g., see ref. 69.
regarding the year of publication as a covariate, this vari- able was used because of the different results on muscle strength between current 5,9 and past literatures 2,51. these differ- ences are likely to be related to study design, conduct, and control because well-designed studies tend to get smaller effects and re- ducing bias over the years 70.
the larger effect found in the study by anderson and kearney 2 also seems to be explained by the low-load resistance training prescription involving more repetitions than any other study table s2, supplemen- tal digital content 2, characteristics of included studies, http:links.lww.commssc234, driving the heterogeneity and significance of this covariate in the muscle strength model.
furthermore, omitting the studies with a high risk of bias 2,42,51 also reduced the significance of this covariate in the model.
the strengths of the present review, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression are as follows: 1 a large number of studies n 28 with up to 747 healthy adults; 2 a model involving simultaneous comparison among low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance training; and 3 methodological feasibility for com- paring different resistance training loads i.e., statistical transi- tivity in the network meta-analysis model.
in addition, considering previous findings on this topic 9,19, the present review also extends the results on muscle hypertrophy and strength, taking into account different moderators of resistance exercise response such as participants, training status, experi- mental design, assessed outcomes, and training prescription when different resistance training loads are undertaken until volitional failure. however, the present study has some limita- tions worthy of comment.
first, studies included in the present review were mostly of low quality because of concerns regard- ing the randomization process and measurement of the out- come. nonetheless, we used a subgroup analysis involving the best-quality studies to minimize such bias, and the re- sults were maintained with minimal differences in the consis- tency analysis.
second, the present investigation excluded nonspecific muscle strengthperformance measures such as maximal voluntary contraction and muscle endurance due to the variability in methods used to assess these outcomes and relevance to our specified outcomes, which would have in- creased the heterogeneity among studies. therefore, our results regarding muscle strength should not be extended to nonspecific muscle strength tests such as isometric or isokinetic muscle strength tests.
third, although recreationally trained participants were included in our analyses, the strength levels reported in the studies were relatively modest, and cer- tainly, the present results cannot be extrapolated for highly strength-trained individuals e.g., bodybuilders, collegiate ath- letes in structured and supervised strength and conditioning programs, and power or strength athletes.
fourth, several studies 4,5,33,37,38,4345,50,52 have performed multiple 1-rm testing throughout the study duration range, 35 times. this may also be considered an issue masking an even greater difference between low- versus moderate- and high-load resistance training programs because of the number of exposures to maximal strength tests and the potential in- creases in muscle strength not related to the intervention per se 71.
fifth, the assessment of muscle size presents numer- ous challenges when evaluating training effects with regard to load, movement, range, and type of contraction, all influencing regional hypertrophy and further complicated by location of measurement, technology, and methodology 72.
finally, the present investigation included mostly studies un- dertaken in young adults 23.4 2.9 yr and should be interpreted with caution when extrapolated to different popula- tions, as exercising until volitional failure is not considered a feasible resistance training prescription for all 73. in summary, the present study explored the resistance training dosage for muscle hypertrophy and strength in healthy young adults.
our findings suggest that to promote muscle hypertrophy, varying loads of resistance training can be undertaken, and one strategy is to perform the exercise to the point of volitional failure.
however, other approaches for http:www.acsm-msse.org 1214 official journal of the american college of sports medicine applied sciences maximizing recruitment of the motor unit pool maybe as ef- fective, without the issues described previously regarding performing high numbers of repetitions with light loads.
thus, a practical application of our results is that a high-load resistance training program 80 of 1-rm, or 8 rm can target both outcomes in shorter periods of train- ing, whereas a moderate range of repetitions 915 rm should be part of the resistance training program for those who do not tolerate exercising at higher i.e., higher intensity or higher resistance loads, eliciting gains in muscle hypertro- phy and muscle strength superior to a low-load program. fur-
thermore, our results can also be applied to those participants with experience in resistance training, indicating a superior muscle hypertrophy effect undertaking more resistance train- ing sessions. p. l. is supported by the national health and medical research council centre of research excellence in prostate cancer survivor- ship scholarship. d. a. g. and r. u. n. are funded by the national health and medical research council centre of research excellence in prostate cancer survivorship.

 why exercise builds muscles: titin mechanosensing controls skeletal muscle growth under load neil ibata and eugene m. terentjev dated: may 6, 2021 muscles sense internally generated and externally applied forces, responding to these in a coordinated hier- archical manner at different time scales. the center of the basic unit of the muscle, the sarcomeric m-band, is perfectly placed to sense the different types of load to which the muscle is subjected.
in particular, the kinase domain tk of titin located at the m-band is a known candidate for mechanical signaling. here, we develop the quantitative mathematical model that describes the kinetics of tk-based mechanosensitive signaling, and predicts trophic changes in response to exercise and rehabilitation regimes. first, we build the kinetic model for tk conformational changes under force: opening, phosphorylation, signaling and autoinhibition.
we nd that tk opens as a metastable mechanosensitive switch, which naturally produces a much greater signal after high-load resistance exercise than an equally energetically costly endurance effort. next, in order for the model to be stable, give coherent predictions, in particular the lag following the onset of an exercise regime, we have to account for the associated kinetics of phosphate carried by atp, and for the non-linear dependence of pro- tein synthesis rates on muscle bre size.
we suggest that the latter effect may occur via the steric inhibition of ribosome diffusion through the sieve-like myolament lattice. the full model yields a steady-state solution homeostasis for muscle cross-sectional area and tension, and a quantitatively plausible hypertrophic response to training as well as atrophy following an extended reduction in tension. i. introduction why does exercise build skeletal muscles, whereas long pe- riods of immobility lead to muscle atrophy?
the anecdotal evidence is clear, and the sports and rehabilitation medicine community has amassed a large amount of empirical knowl- edge on this topic.
but the community has not as yet ad- dressed and understood two key phenomena which underly hypertrophy and atrophy: how does the muscle know that it is being exercised when it is certainly not the tactile sense, processed via the nervous system, that is at play in this, and how does it signal to provoke a morphological response to an increase or a lack of applied load?
in some communities, there is a perception that muscle grows after exercise due to its in- ternal repair of micro-damage inicted by the load. however, it is obvious that such an idea cannot be true, for several rea- sons: most of the tissue repair occurs by growing connective tissue, while we need an increase of intricately hierarchical myolament structure, also this concept will not account for atrophy developing in microgravity or after extended bedrest.
here we develop a quantitative theoretical model which seeks to explain both of these processes. in order to be useful, the model must build on the relevant knowledge accumulated from studies of the anatomy and physiology of muscles, as well as the biological physics of molecular interactions and forces.
muscles, their constituent cells, and the structure of their molecular lament mesh must respond mechanosensitively i.e. in a manner which depends on the changes in the magni- tude of the forces and stresses that arise during the contraction and extension of the muscle at many different timescales. at the fastest time scales tens or hundreds of milliseconds, skeletal muscles can produce near maximal force for jump- ing or for the ght-or-ight response.
most muscles also go cavendish laboratory, university of cambridge, j.j. thomson avenue, cambridge, cb3 0he, u.k.; emt1000cam.ac.uk through cycles of shortening and lengthening with a period of the order of a second in the vast majority of sprint or en- durance exercise running, climbing, etc. at a much longer timescale of many days, a muscle must also be able to mea- sure changes in its overall use in order to effect adaptive mus-
cle hypertrophyatrophy ultimately helping to prevent injury on the scale of months and years. how the muscle cell keeps track of the history of its load and stress inputs within a number of intracellular output sig- nals which then go on to stimulate or inhibit muscle protein synthesis, is inherently an incredibly complex biochemical question.
with the help of recent theoretical insights into the folding and unfolding rates of mechanosensor proteins un- der force, we hope to gain insights into the rst part of this puzzle for the specic case of muscle hypertrophy. to make progress, we use a simple model for force-induced transitions between the different conformations of the titin kinase tk mechanosensor.
if the conformational change helps create an intracellular signal, we can model the signals strength in terms of the duration and intensity of the mechanical inputs external force on the tk domain in our case. force chain the individual sub-cellular, cellular and super-cellular components of a muscle act in concert to scale up a vast num- ber of molecular force-generating events into a macroscopic force. the hierarchical structure of the muscle see fig.
1 allows the macroscopic and microscopic responses to mirror each other 10. the sarcomere is the elementary unit of the muscle cell and the basic building block of the sliding lament hypoth- esis 11, 12. its regular and conserved structure, sketched in fig. 2 for the vertebrate striated muscle, allows for a series transmission of tension over the whole length of the muscle.
in vertebrates, six titin molecules are wrapped around each thick lament 13, 14 on either side of the midpoint of the arxiv:2102.00836v2 q-bio.to 5 may 2021 2 nm f f thick lament myosin bundle sarcomere ...... .. ... . . . . myobril muscle bre muscle cell nc fig. 1. the textbook hierarchy in the anatomy of skeletal muscle.
the overall muscle is characterised by its cross-section area csa, which contains a certain number nc of mucle bers the muscle cells with multiple nuclei, or multinucleate myocytes.
a given mus- cle has a nearly xed number of myocytes: between nc 1000 for the tensor tympani, and nc 1,000,000 for large muscles: gastroc- nemius, temporalis, etc. 1. muscle cells contain a variable num- ber nm of parallel myobrils organelles, each of which can be divided into repeated mechanical elements called sarcomeres. the typical length of a sarcomere is ca. 2m, so there are ca. 105 of these elements in series along a ber in a typical large muscle 2.
each sarcomere contains a number of parallel thick laments heli- cal bundles of myosin, red whose constituent myosins pull on the actin polymers in the thin laments f-actin, blue to generate force. within the myobrils, the spacing between neighbouring myosin l- aments is ca. 0.046 m at rest 3, 4.
the typical cross-sectional area of a single muscle bre substantially varies between individuals and muscle types, but is of the order of 4000 m2 5. accounting for some 15 of the cell volume being outside of the myobrils 6, this means that a typical muscle bre has some ca. 2,000,000 paral- lel laments across, between which the macroscopic force f must be divided. rather than using this awkward number, we will express our results in terms of the total myobrillar csa within a single muscle bre.
a chemically activated muscle bre with a csa of 4000m2 shows a force in the vicinity of 300-1000n for untrained individ- uals with a very large individual variation 7, which translates to an average lament force of 150-500pn see supplementary a.6. training can increase the neural activation level 8 as well as the number of active myosin heads and the maximum voluntary contrac- tion force per lament e.g. by stretch activation 9.
because of this, we would expect resistance training to lead the lament forces to tend towards the upper end of the range 500pn. sarcomere: the m-line. during active muscle contraction, myosin heads motors bind to actin and walk in an atp-controlled sequence of steps 15 along the thin laments. when a resistance is ap- plied, the myosin motor exerts a force against it.
during slow resistance training in both concentric and eccentric motions, tension is passed along the sarcomere primarily through the thin lament, myosin heads 16, 17, the thick lament, and into the cross-bridge region of the sarcomere where thick la- ments are crosslinked with their associated m-band proteins. the load in each of the sarcomere components ultimately depends on the relative compliance of elements.
the relative load on the thick lament and the m-band segments of titin when the lament is either under internal contracting or ex- ternal extending load is discussed in supplementary a.4. it is well-known that titin is under load when the sarcomere is extended 18, 19.
recent x-ray diffraction experiments 20 suggest that that the thick lament may be more compliant than originally thought; if so, m-line titin is likely substan- open tk can be phosphorylated z-disk m-band a-band z-disk titin pevk f f fig. 2. a sketch of the mechanically active elements of sarcomere. the thick laments are crosslinked across the m-line, with six titin molecules bonded to these laments, on each side of the m-line.
the full lament is under the measurable microscopic force identied in fig. 1, shown by the blue arrow in the middle lament. at the molec- ular level, the force is borne by the individual titin and myosin la- ments. if we assume that the thick lament and titin extend by the same amount during muscle contraction, then the graphical relation- ship between titin force and force in the thick lament is illustrated in figure 3 in the supplementary material.
this gure illustrates an additional possibility: if titin wraps around the thick lament top, then tk can lengthen substantially more than we consider in this work, for titin extending with the thick lament bottom. the force in tk would be much higher, making tk bear more load and create a greater mechanosensitive signal. tially extended and loaded titin when the muscle actively gen- erates force.
others disagree 21 and attribute the change in line spacing in diffusion experiments to a mechanosensitive activation of the entire thick lament at low forces. either way, m-band titin is under some tension during active muscle contraction. this situation is sketched in fig. 2. we estimate the force in each lament both macroscopi- cally and microscopically see the full discussion in supple- mentary part a.2 and a.3.
we divide the force in the entire muscle by the number of active myolaments see fig. 1 to nd a large variation in force per lament in untrained individ- uals 150500pn 7. muscle bre neuronal and molecular activation increases with training 8, 9, so the higher forces are more likely representative of lament forces in trained in- dividuals.
the maximum lament forces extrapolated from x-ray diffraction studies 22 are higher at 600pn, possi- bly because the actin only partially binds to myosin in normal contractions, maximum forces do not last very long, and be- cause the muscle does not coordinate perfectly as a whole. in supplementary part a.4, we graphically nd an approximate relation between titin and thick lament force.
in particular, it suggests that the force per titin be close to 25pn at the maxi- mum voluntary contraction force. in section a.1 of the supplementary material, we discuss different candidates of mechanosensitive signaling in the sar- comere, and highlight the reasons why titin kinase is a par- ticularly good candidate for this role, and why we have not considered some of these other candidates here.
tk is a mechanosensor of the second kind cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their environment using two main classes of force receptors. 3 the rst type of mechanosensor responds immediately under force 23, 24. mechanosensitive ion channels are the archety- pal example of such a sensor and have been proposed to play a role in tactile signaling transforming a mechanical signal into chemical 23, 25.
however, the ions which they use in signaling are rapidly depleted, making it difcult for these sensors to signal in response to a sustained force. the other type of mechanosensor, dubbed of the 2nd kind by cockerill et al. 26, can either indirectly measure the response coefcients, or time-integrate an external force acting on the molecule.
the focal adhesion kinase fak mechanosensor 27, 28 is a good example: it can sense sub- strate stiffness by measuring the tension in the integrin-talin- actin force chain, which binds a cell to its extracellular ma- trix ecm. fak and the tk domain both open under force, can be phosphorylated, and appear pivotal to mechanosensi- tive signalling, they also has many structural similarities.
tk has already been suggested to act as mechanosensor 2931, and although recent experimental work has focussed mainly on other regions of the titin molecule, we believe that it is worth returning to the tk domain to examine it as a time- integrating mechanosensor.
in the results section below, we see that the metastability of the tk open state, when the mus- cle is under steady-state passive tension, can indeed allow for the tk domain to help produce increased signal levels long after the end of an exercise session. tk domain opens under force many signaling pathways use a molecular switch to ini- tiate a signaling cascade.
one of the most common post- translational modications of proteins involves the reversible addition of a phosphate group to some amino acids mainly tyrosine; this addition alters the local polarity of the target protein, allowing it to change its shape and to bind a new sub- strate 32.
phosphorylation can form the basis for signaling if an input changes the proteins conformation, from a native folded conformation which cannot bind to a phosphate group often called autoinhibited, to an open conformation in which the geometry of the molecule allows phosphate groups to be donated to the phosphorylation site 27. the phospho- rylated protein can then bind to a third substrate molecule, and can either directly catalytically affect or indirectly activate a signaling pathway.
protein unfolding under force has been analysed exten- sively, beginning with studies of the titin ig domain 33, 34. these experiments show characteristic force-extension curves, which can help deduce the transition energies between conformations for the molecules in question. we note that the ig domains unfold under quite a high force 33, 35, 36 and could initially appear to be candidates for mechanosen- sors.
however, very few phosphorylation sites have been found on the ig domains, compared with the remainder of the molecule 37, suggesting that they do not contribute to force- induced signaling, but rather help control the length of the titin molecule and avoid immediate sarcomere damage under high load. titin kinase was initially thought to be the only catalytic domain on titin 38.
bogomolovas et al. 39 suggest that tk acts as a pseudokinase, simply scaffolding the aggregation of a protein complex when it is phosphorylated, and allowing for another protein to be allosterically phosphorylated. com- putational and experimental studies of tk have shown that its force-length response also follows a characteristic step- wise unfolding pattern, but with much smaller steps than those observed for the ig domains.
in particular, afm experi- ments 29 show that the presence of atp an energy supply changes the conformational energy landscape of the molecule as it is stretched. this shows that the molecule possesses a long-lasting open conformation of its tk domain, in which it can accommodate the recruitment of signaling molecules up- stream of a mechanosensitive signaling pathway, before the protein unfolds completely and potentially loses its signalling ability.
being the largest known molecule in vertebrates, titin interacts with an unsurprisingly large number of molecules 40, 41; linke et al. 42 summarized this knowledge in a protein-protein interaction network ppin, shown in their figure 2, where in particular the nbr1 and murf pathway lo- calized in m-band is shuttled into the nucleus, leading to srf and transcription of new actin. methods used in modelling we model a resistance training repetition as a piecewise function for force.
during the loading phase start at t 0, the force increases from the initial force ft 0 and asymp- totically approaches the maximal force per lament fmax dur- ing the repetition, with a rate kf 30s1. the full-muscle rate of force development is substantially lower, at ca. 5s1 43, but we assume that there is a lag due to the macroscopic muscle providing some slack before macroscopic force de- velopment.
it therefore seems likely that the molecular rate of sarcomere force development which impacts the rate of titin being placed under force is closer to the much faster rate of force increase during muscle tetani. during the unloading phase, the muscle force decreases with a fast rate same rate as force development for tetani, a bit slower for twitches, but ultimately insignicant relative to the timescales of a muscle repetition.
the force per titin as well as the muscle opening and closing rates kand k are calculated at every time step. because the tk conformations quickly change during exer- cise, the next time step of the numerical integration is adap- tively calculated at each time step as a fraction of the greatest fractional change in all of the molecular species in the model. several repetitions make up a set, and several sets make up an exercise session.
the exercise regime is assumed to be adap- tive, such that the repetition force on tk remains constant as the total myobrillar csa increases. ii. the model here we explain why we believe that the kinetic processes schematically shown in fig. 3 are the necessary elements for 4 any tk-based treatment of mechanosensing of the second kind and of subsequent mechanosensitive intracellular signal- ing. our model can be divided into three parts: the opening and phosphorylation of the tk domain.
this stage is highly non-linear because tk opens as a mechanosensitive switch and because the mechanosen- sitive complex binds allosterically. the open state is metastable if the muscle is under a steady-state load. the creation and degradation of signaling molecules, of new ribosomes, and of structural proteins. all of these rates can be approximated as linear, apart from a size feedback term, which arises because ribosomal diffu- sion is sterically hindered in large cells see discussion below.
exercise can only be so hard before the muscle depletes its short-term energy supplies. the balance between en- ergy generation from oxidative phosphorylation and the depletion of short-term energy stores has to be consid- ered to correctly model the dynamic response.
a. opening and phosphorylation of tk domain the energy barrier for the transition between the closed native domain conformation, and the open conformation which supports atp-binding and phosphorylation is the key determinant of the kinetic transition rates between the two tk states. afm data collected by puchner et al. 29 is essential here; we match the relevant tk conformations to their data and explain how to extract several important model parame- ters in parts a.4
and a.5 of the supplementary information. in the absence of any signaling, the concentration of total freebound atp is constant, and the transitions from closed to open to phosphorylated tk domain conformations are sim- ple and reversible: closed open: tk can open under force with a force- dependent rate constant kf and likewise close with a force-dependent rate constant kf. here we use the framework of 28 to derive these two rate constants.
the concentrations of the closed and open conforma- tions are nc and no, respectively, cf. fig. 3. open phosphorylated: the open state of tk can be phosphorylated with a rate constant kp, the total rate of this process depends on both the concentration of atp and of the open tk: atp and no. the phosphory- lated state with the concentration np can also sponta- neously de-phosphorylate with a rate constant kr, but cannot spontaneoulsy close until then.

these equations are examined in supplementary information, part a.6 where they are shown to adequately reproduce the phosphorylation kinet- ics of tk measured by puchner et al. 29, providing an a posteriori justication for their use. b. signal generation from phosphorylated tk the phosphorylated tk domain can bind the zinc n- ger domain protein nbr1 44, and begin to form an aggre- gate; the concentration of the signaling complexes ns must be introduced with a new separate kinetic equation.
the mechanosensing complex identied in the most general for- mulation by lange 44 is a multispecies aggregate, which we consider in more detail in supplementary part a.7. srf, the mechanosensitive signaling molecule in the lange model, is known to undergo activation by phosphorylation 45, 46. there are many phosphorylation sites on nbr1, p62 and some on murf 47, which suggests that srf could be activated by phosphate transfer originating from tk.
an acti- vation would most likely irreversibly alter the conformation of the signaling complex, and result in the disassembly of the complex every time a new signaling molecule was acti- vated. assuming that the complete mechanosensing complex has a time-independent probability to disassemble, with a rate kdnsns, we estimate the corresponding rate constant kdns from experiments 48 that show the increase in phospho-srf ac- tivated signal after exercise. they nd
that the level of acti- vated srf binding to dna increases by a factor of 2 an hour 5 after skeletal muscle cell contraction, and reaches half of its maximum increase after 10 minutes of exercise. this means that the degradation rate of the mechanosensing complex oc- curs with a half-life of ca. 10 minutes kdns 1600 s1.
we can now rewrite our kinetic equations to add the forma- tion and degradation rates of the signaling complex as well as the activation of the srf signal: dnc dt knc kno 1 dno dt knc kno kpnoatpkrnp kdnsns 2b dnp dt kpnoatpkrnp ksnp 3b dns dt ksnp kdnsns 5 nc no np ns ntitin constraint 4b dnsrf dt kdnsns kdsnsrf . 6 the concentration of atp is expressed in number per titin: to- tal phosphate is assumed to scale proportionately to the size of the myobril and the number of titin molecules.
in supple- mentary part c, we also track the kinetics of atp depletion during intense exercise. the additional equations are mathe- matically more complicated, and do not help understand the full model, but are included in the numerical simulations in the results section. these are the core equations which describe the relatively fast activation of a signaling molecule during muscle load- ing.
we show in the results section below that they display a very pronounced switching behavior: in other words, small changes in tension result in large changes to the signal concen- tration. we also nd that these equations support an increase in the concentration of signal possibly srf for a substantial time of the order of a couple of days, which could help account for the immediate increase in protein synthesis post-exercise. but we shall see in the next section that a simple one-step sig-
nal cannot by itself account for the observed time-dependence of hypertrophy. c. muscle protein synthesis after mechanosensor signaling the constituent molecules of most signaling pathways have a short lifetime relative to that of the structural proteins. it is also well documented that a few bouts of exercise do not have a tangible effect on muscle volume, and that muscle takes at least a few of weeks to begin to show visible hypertrophic adaptations.
the debate on whether true hypertrophy is soon detected, or whether initial post-exercise changes in muscle csa are the signs of muscle micro-damage, is a rather fraught one 4952. three weeks of resistance training appears to be a consensus time, after which true hypertrophy is actu- ally detected. this means that there has to be a way of in- tegrating the signal over such a long period of time be- yond the scope of the simple force-integration supported by a metastable open state of tk.
here we combine the above model of mechanosensitive signaling with a simple model of protein synthesis from a signaling molecule, and propose a mechanism by which this integration may occur. based on a review and discussion of the current literature in the supplementary information, part b.2, we conclude that it is likely an increase in ribosome biogenesis rather than the temporary increase in mrna transcript number which allows for this time integration of the signal.
its effect would be to suppress uctuations in the concentration of tk conforma- tions or signaling molecules, smoothly increasing the concen- tration of the structural muscle proteins over the time similar to the half-life of ribosomes. we suggest that this effect could help explain the delay of a few weeks between starting re- sistance exercise and the rst detection of measurable muscle growth, as noted by trainers and rehabilitation specialists.
new experiments show that sarcomeric proteins are synthe- sised in situ at the sarcomeric z-line and m-band 53. as far as we are aware, ribosomal subunits can only move by diffu- sion, whereas mrna can be actively transported to the syn- thesis site. the inhibition of the diffusion of ribosomal sub- units by the myolament lattice 54 could reduce the synthe- sis of new sarcomeric proteins by a sizeable amount 510 in adult myocytes.
the fractional reduction in titin synthesis can be written in the form ntitin, where the coefcient depends on the ribosome diffusion constant, the lattice spac- ing and the rate of lysosomal degradation. this term has sev- eral important consequences: it provides a bound on muscle growth or shrinkage, and it affects the speed of muscle size adaptations. we examine this point in more detail in supple- mentary part b.4.
we use the number of titin molecules ntitin in the muscle - bre cross-section as a proxy for the muscle bre csa, because the hierarchical sarcomere structure is well-conserved in most muscles at rest. when necessary, one can convert from one to the other as in fig. 1. the above equations are combined as follows more details in supplementary part b: dnc dt kfnc kno 1 dno dt knc kno kpnoatpkrnp kdnsns 2b dnp dt kpnoatpkrnp ksnp 3b dns dt ksnp kdnsns 5 nc no

once we have ze- roed our problem by checking that this value makes sense in terms of steady-state tension muscle tone, in sections b and c, we consider the dynamics of equations 1-5 for tk only, to show that it does indeed open as a metastable mechanosen- sitive switch. following that, we will proceed to study what effects different types of resistance exercise have on muscle bre csa, and compare them with reports from the literature.

10 the rst key result here is that the force on the tk domain, which maintains a steady state muscle bre csa, is deter- mined almost exclusively by two parameters: the energy bar- rier g0 between the closed and open conformations of the tk domain, and the unfolding distance umax. it is clear that changing any of the coefcients in the logarithm in 9 would only have a minor effect on the steady-state force. the typical resting muscle forces are plotted in fig.

g0 is expressed in di- mensionless units scaled by the thermal energy 1kbt, with t 310k. the values of rate constants are given in table i, and the following typical concentrations were used: p 2000 per titin, nbr1st 0.1 per titin, 0.5, these are from the appendix and will confuse the reader. the circle marks the sweet spot where the likely values of umax and g0 should be. note that both g0 and umax are xed physiological values, as is the maximum steady-state force.
we do not have precise values for any of these see supplementary part a.5 for a more detailed explanation of the uncertainty in g0, so it is still instructional to plot our models prediction of the steady-state force for different plausible values of the other two constants. the other key point is that a small change in the muscle steady-state force perhaps supported by an increase in ten- don tension, which lengthens the sarcomeres can maintain a large change in muscle size.
the fractional change in the steady state muscle tone as a function of the fractional change in muscle size is plotted in fig. 5. combining supplementary part a.2, a.3 maximum thick lament force and a.4 titin force in terms of thick lament force, we estimate the force per titin during a contraction at the maximum voluntary contraction mvc to be 25pn.
in the low-load regime, there is very little active muscle force otherwise known as muscle tone, perhaps only 1-2 of the mvc force 65 only at most ca. 1-2pn per tk if titins were to bear most of the load, which matches well with the relative oxygen consumption in resting muscle 66. when sarcom- eres operate at their optimal length, a non-negligible passive tension is developed by amongst other effects the exten- sion of titin 67.
in this regime, most of the load originates from this baseline stretch in the sarcomeres: indeed, white- head et al. 68 found that passive tension at the optimal sar- comere length was of the order of 5-10 of the mvc force. the passive tension value is much more consistent with our estimate for the resting tension per titin in the steady-state see fig.

the values of opening energy g0 are labelled on the plot. the values of rate constants are given in table i, and the following typical concentrations were used: p 2000 per titin, nbr1st 0.002 per titin, 0.5. the maximum opening dis- tance of tk was taken as umax 27nm. the values for g0 and umax were estimated from afm data and molecular dynamics simulations conducted by puchner et al. 29 in supplementary part a.5. to resistance training much more readily.
the titin stiffness slowly diminishes after exercise, but the temporary increase in stiffness could also contribute to the time-integration of the mechanosensitive signal. this complication is beyond the scope of our model. b. titin kinase as a metastable mechanosensitive switch in fig. 6, we see that tk obeys switching kinetics: above a critical load, its closed conformation is no longer favoured. however, the low tk opening and closing rates k and k plotted in fig.
7 do not allow tk to quickly change between its conformations at physiological loads. if resistance exer- cise increases the number of open tks, their number will remain elevated up to days after exercise; in other words, the tk openphosphorylatedsignalling complex-bound state is metastable. we use numerical simulations to explore this point further in the next section.
tk signaling increases linearly with exercise duration bar- ring the effects of fatigue, whereas opening rates and sig- nalling increase exponentially with force in tk. while tk force scales roughly linearly with myosin force see fig. 3 in the supplementary material, this allows mechanosensitive signaling to increase much faster than the corresponding en- ergetic cost at high exercise force.
at very high forces, how- ever, it appears that tk force increases much more slowly than myosin force, leading to a plateau in the efciency of mechanosensitive signalling fig. 4 in the supplementary ma- terial.
excluding mechanosensitive signalling at the steady- state force which is efcient because thick lament force is low, but does not do much to change muscle csa, signal- ing in response to resistance training is always more effec- tive as the load increases until at least about 70 of the mvc force. our current model does not extend to how mus- 2 4 6 8 10 10 6 1 f pn titin 0.001 g higher g lower n n titin i 10 9 10 12 10 15 nc ns np no fig.

note that the molecule switches from being preferably closed to preferably openphosphorylatedsignaling slightly above the steady-state force of a few pn. but even though the steady-state conformation may be favoured at forces even slightly above the resting muscle tension, titin takes a long time to open enough to actually signal in large numbers, because the opening rate k is much less than 1 s1 at low- and medium forces see fig. 7 for an illustration of this behaviour.

we suggest that this behaviour is the basis for high intensity resistance training: doubling the force increases mechanosensitive signaling by several orders of magnitude. cle fatigue induces changes in muscle stiffness 69, 70, which could alter tk signaling kinetics at high forces as well.
c. long-term mechanosensitive signaling and response in order to compare with experimental data in the literature, we consider a typical resistance exercise session consisting of 3 sets of 10 repetitions more details in the methods section below.
this mimics a common resistance training program see e.g. defreitas et al. 49, who set up resistance training 8 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 time min force pn 20 15 10 5 0 o n 0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0.004 -2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 time min fraction of open, phosphorylated tk p n p n o n a b ns fig. 8. simulation of an exercise session involving three sets of 10 ten-second repetitions. a all repetitions are performed at the same force per titin, but their duration is cut short upon reaching exhaus- tion.
as the number of titins increases, we assume that the training regime adapts by proportionately increasing the repetition force. b the depletion of atp leads to a temporary drop in phosphorylated tk during exercise. however, the sum of open, phosphorylated and signaling complex-bound tk steadily increases during the exercise. since the closing rate of tk is quite low of the order of 105s1, de-
pending on the number of attempts at crossing the energy barrier and the barrier height g0, the baseline concentrations of phosphory- lated and signaling tk conformations remain elevated after exercise. sessions with 8-12 repetitions to failure over 3 sets. choos- ing a specic value of repetition force is not straightforward because while most force studies consider mvc force, most hypertrophy programs compare the training load to the single- repetition maximum load for a given exercise.
the muscle force during one full repetition is necessarily smaller than the instantaneous force. determining the corresponding force per tk might be further complicated because titin is under more load when the muscle is stretched passive force than when it is actively contracting. nevertheless, our choice of 20 pn per titin seems to be supported by several factors discussed here and in the supplementary information.
we simulate a typical exercise session as a xed number of repetitions at a given force, grouped into a xed number of sets, as shown in fig. 8a more details in the methods section. during each repetition, the opening rate k of tk becomes much greater than its closing rate, which decreases the proportion of closed tk and increases its propensity to signal.
because the muscle is under a combination of passive 0 0.001 0.002 0.003 0 5 10 15 20 25 0 2 time min force pn fraction of open tk, n 0.5 1 1.5 2.5 3 3.5 o fig. 9. the rst set of 10 ten-second repetitions from fig.
8. note that the repetitions become shorter as atp runs out during the period of high load: as the atp level falls below a critical value which we set to a half of the homeostatic level, the muscle can no longer sustain the load and the only possibility is to drop the weight and return to the steady-state force. so the period of loading becomes shorter than the prescribed period, shon in dashed line in the plot and arrows marking the prescribed period.
and active tension at rest, the closing rate of titin is small after exercise, even though it is greater than the opening rate see fig. 7. this allows tk to revert to its steady-state confor- mation after a time of the order of hours to days, in a manner which depends on the number of attempts at crossing the en- ergy barrier between the closed and open conformations see supplementary part a.5, as well as the height of the activa- tion barrier g0.
the metastability of the open state at steady- state tension would then naturally allow the muscle to produce a mechanosensitive signal long after the end of exercise. this might account for the increase in myobrillar protein synthe- sis in the two days following exercise, specically resistance training 71, 72. the important aspect of exercise, naturally reected in our model, is the effect of fatigue. to make it more clear, we plot the same data as in fig.
8, zooming in to just one the rst set of repetitions in fig. 9. both myosin motors increase their atp consumption under the high load, and the freshly open tk domains require atp for phosphorylation. during the high-intensity loading, the level of atp could drop be- low a critical value, after which the muscle would no longer be able to maintain the force: the only option is to drop the weight and return to the steady-state force recovery stage.
we see that this effect of fatigue occurs after a few repetitons in fig. 9. we also nd, in this simulation of model exercise, that subsequent sets of repetitions have this fatigue-driven cutoff of the later loading periods becoming less pronounced, be- cause the overall level of atp marginally increases during the session.
in figs. 10 and 11, and afterwards, we return to measur- ing the muscle size directly by the total myobrillar csa by converting to that from the measure of titin molecules, which is equivalent but carries less intuitive appeal. since the volume of a myonuclear domain is close to 16000 m3, and remains conserved in a developed adult muscle 73, and 9 the density of titins is also an approximate constant ca. 3000 per m3, see fig.
1 or in an alternative equivalent estimate: the density of titins across the unit area of csa ca. 6000 per m2 allows quantitative measure of csa as our output. also note, that since in this test we are applying a constant force per titin, and the csa increases with time, this means that the actual exercise load to the whole muscle must be in- creasing proportionally in our current simplied model the relation between csa and ntitin is linear to achieve the opti- mal growth. in fig.
10 we test the long-term consequences of a regu- lar resistance training program the standard model exercise as in fig. 8a repeated every 3 days. several curves are pre- sented, showing the nal homeostatic saturation level, and the time to reach it, dependent on the key model parameter: the energy barrier g0 for tk opening. the earlier discussion based on the data obtained by puchner et al. 29, and the structural analogy between tk and fak 27, 74, suggest that g0 could be around 30kbt or ca.
75 kjmol. the comparison between plots a and b in fig. 10 is im- portant. as our model relies on the value of force per titin f, the total load on the muscle is distributed across laments in parallel across the csa.
so if one maintains the same exercise load, the effective force per titin diminishes in proportion to the growing csa, the result of which is shown in plot a. in contrast, one might modify the exercise by increasing the total load in proportion with csa plot b shows the result of such an adaptive regime. in the non-adaptive case, the nal satu- ration is reached in about a year and the total csa increase is about 30 assuming g0 30kbt.
in the adaptive exer- cise, the nal saturation is reached much slower, but the total myobrillar csa increase is about 88: almost doubles the myobrillar component of the muscle volume in about 2 years time. it is reassuring that the experimental measurement of de freitas et al. 49 of csa growth over a period of 8 weeks, in a similar exercise regime, quantitatively agrees with our pre- diction of ca. 1 csa increase a week in the initial period.
the regularity of the exercise has a strong effect: the long- term magnitude of hypertrophy predicted by the model is af- fected by what happens on the daily basis. fig. 11a com- pares the long-term results when the interval between the model exercise tex varies from frequent, to very sparse bouts the tex 3 days case is fig. 10. we nd that the extent of muscle hypertrophy is roughly linearly dependent on the exercise frequency.
we have seen that the tk mechanosensor can increase the rate of signal activation for an extended period of time af- ter exercise. but this signal does not directly correlate with protein synthesis in the immediate aftermath of exercise. in particular, there is a known lag between the start of an exer- cise regime and the detection of muscle hypertrophy 51, 52.
this lag can be accounted for in our model if ribosomes are the main factor limiting an increase in protein synthesis, and must be made more abundant before hypertrophy can occur, see fig. 11b. the remainder of the results section uses the full model which includes srf signaling, ribosomes and titin number. time days 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 0 csa 1000 m 7 6 5 4 3 2 g 28 0 42 40 30 35 time days 200 400 600 800 1000 0 g 40 0 35 28 30 3.4 3.6 3.8 4.2 4.0 4.4 4.6 a b csa 1000 m 2 fig.
10. time course of muscle growth in response to a regular re- sistance training program exercise of fig. 8, every 3 days. a the total muscle load f is kept constant, so the force per titin f effec- tively diminishes as the csa increases. b the force per titin f is maintained constant 20 pn, as discussed before, which effectively implies that the total muscle load f increases in proportion with csa vertical axis.
several curves for different values of the energy bar- rier g0 are labelled on the plot. as might be expected, muscle csa changes are faster and greater in magnitude if the energy bar- rier g0 is smaller i.e. tk opens faster during exercise, and signals to a greater extent. we overlay the predictions of our model with measurements of fractional changes in muscle csa over an 8-week period, measured by de freitas et al. 49 red crosses, same values in both prlots.
an initial force per titin of 20 pn matches well with real data, showing a ca. 1 growth per week. d. adaptations to resistance training exercise we showed in section 2.a above that constant titin kinase mechanosensing at the steady state muscle tension allows the muscle to maintain its size.
in order to consider dynamic changes in muscle size, we must rst assure ourselves that it reaches a new steady-state; secondly, that it predicts that muscles grow with the correct time-dependence; and nally, we must check whether the model predictions for the mag- nitude of change in muscle size are in the reasonable range, given that we have no free parameters all rate constants and concentrations are independently known. in fig.
12, we see that both muscle growth during the ex- ercise program, and muscle detraining after exercise program ends, are strongly dependent on the feedback from the slow diffusion of ribosomes across the large and sterically hindered sarcoplasm.
greater muscle bre csa at the start of train- ing implies more ribosomal diffusion blocking, hence a higher 10 10 20 30 0 3.54 3.44 3.42 3.40 3.38 40 a b time days csa 1000 m 2 50 t 2 days ex t 3 days ex t 4 days ex t 6 days ex t 12 days ex 3.52 3.50 3.48 3.46 time days 500 1000 1500 0 3.5 3 t 2 days ex t 3 days ex t 4 days ex t 6 days ex t 12 days ex 4.5 4 5.5 5 6.5 6 csa 1000 m 2 fig. 11. time course of muscle response for different exercise fre- quencies. here we take g0 35 see fig.
10, and a representative value of ribosome diffusion inhibition ntitin 0.1 see discussion in fig. 12 for further details. a full duration of the simulation: the total myobrillar csa asymptotically tends to a steady-state after a few years. b the onset of muscle hypertrophy lags the start of the exercise regime by about a week, because tk opening rates are slow, and because the signal is integrated by a combination of srf and ribosomes.
the initial rate of change of the total myobrillar csa can be compared with experiments, which show 1 csa changes per week in response to high intensity resistance exercise 75. this simulation shows a similar rate of csa change, which means that a tk maximum force of 20 pn during high-intensity resistance ex- ercise could produce an adequate signal for muscle hypertrophy to occur. because of the switch-like nature of tk, it is unlikely that this maximum load on tk be too different from 20 pn.
this force value is consistent with a picture where the myosins bear most of the load during active muscle contraction and titin acts as a parallel stretch sensor. hindrance term ntitin resulting in a faster, lower magnitude response to the same training load. this behaviour is qualita- tively observed in the literature: strength trained athletes re- spond to a much lesser degree to a resistance training regime, see e.g. 75.
after stopping a resistance training programme, muscle csa slowly decreases, eventually returning to its pre-trained homeostatic value. the time course of detraining is harder to investigate. low values of two months 8, 76 for skeletal muscle, to several years for recovering hypertrophic cardiac muscle 77, have been reported.
in our model, we observe reasonable time-courses which match this range for detrain- ing for a 5-10 degradation of ribosomes before they arrive 4 7 6 5 3 8 initial n 0.05 titin n 0.1 titin n 0.15 titin n 0.2 titin n 0.25 titin n 0.3 titin time days 1000 2000 3000 0 4000 csa 1000 m 2 fig.
12. time course of muscle growth and loss starting after 600 days of hypertrophy in response to a regular resistance training pro- gram every 3 days with 3 sets of 10 repetitions at 20 pn per titin our estimate of 70 1rm, followed by detraining. the diffusive feedback depends on the degree of sarcoplasmic titin degradation, which in turn increases with myonuclear domain size and lysosomal activity. slow detraining may combine with an initial fast loss due to atrophic conditions see below.
in this case a 510 ribosome degradation en-route to the titin synthesis sites 0.05 ntitin 0.1 appears to support training and detraining at the correct rates, see 8, 49, 76, 77. at the sarcomere, or for very low force feedback in the range of 0.001 0.005 see fig. 12. there are some exceptions to this: career athletes main- tain signicantly higher muscle csa a long time after retiring 78, and the body maintains a memory of prior resistance training events 79 by changing its methylome.
it seems likely that the body can develop and maintain a higher resting muscle tone if chronic resistance training changes the molec- ular architecture of the muscle. this complication is beyond the scope of our model. e. atrophy and recovery from bedrest or microgravity when the body is subjected to bed-rest, microgravity 80, famine 81, or as the consequence of several pathologies 82, muscle size can very rapidly decrease.
any mechanism which increases degradation rates srf, ribosomes, titin degradation rates in our model, see table i will necessarily cause atrophy, and our model conrms this see supplementary part e for detail. extended periods of bed-rest and microgravity are the more interesting atrophy-inducing conditions to study in the context of mechanosensing, as it is the sudden lack of tension, which promotes muscle degradation.
in other words, the steady-state force applied to the muscle the homeostatic tone is suddenly decreased, and the muscle metabolism responds. we nd a quick decrease in muscle csa after a series of drastic param- eter changes at the start of our simulations, but it is the kinet- ics of muscle recovery after atrophy which appear to be more dependent on the type of feedback in the model.
in practice, muscle is seen to recover relatively rapidly after very substan- tial atrophy, with most of the recovery occurring over a 1-2 11 time days 100 200 300 0 3.2 2.4 2 100 200 300 0 400 a 400 500 4 3 2 1 0 f 0.9999f st st f 0.9995f st st f 0.999f st st f 0.998f st st f 0.995f st st f 0.999f st st f 0.99f st st f 0.98f st st f 0.95f st st f 0.995f st st b 3.6 csa 1000 m 2 csa 1000 m 2 2.8 time days fig. 13. time course of muscle atrophy as the steady state force fst discussed in 9 and fig.
4 is suddenly diminished from the steady state value to a lower value. in this simulation, after 120 days, the force is brought up to its steady state value again. the recovery speed depends on exactly how the muscle force scales with muscle csa during atrophy, the force feedback discussed in supplementary part b.4. a the case of negligible force feedback 0.005 leads to an unphysiologically slow rates of atrophy and recovery, over sev- eral months.
b higher force feedback 0.02 leads to a much more reasonable recovery rates, which we consider close to clinical observations. week period 83. fig. 13a shows our model predictions with the simplifying assumption that there was no feedback relationship between muscle force per bre and the csa in the case of hypertrophy. the curves show a response to a very small decrease of steady-state tone maximum 0.5 in black curve, and recopvery when fst returns to its value prescribed by the 9 after 120 days.
a very slow recovery of homeostatic muscle csa is found, not in agreement with observations. however, once we include the feedback, when the force per lament decreases with an increasing csa, the rate of re- sponse becomes much more realistic, see fig. 13b. here a much greater force increase is applied up to 5 in the black curve, and we see both the atrophy onset and the recovery reaching the saturated steady state values within 60 days.
this suggests that a reasonable force feedback scale with the pa- rameter 0.02 or even higher, see supplementary part e for detail is a required feature of our model, if quantitative predictions are to be obtained. an unexpected feature of plots in fig. 13b is the muscle overshoot during the fast recovery after atrophy.
it seems likely that the several intrinsic processes have low rate but high sensitivity, resulting in muscle keeping a memory of its previous architecture during atrophy, much like the career- trained athletes whose muscle csa remains higher than nor- mal after retirement. this would translate into a correspond- ing increase in the muscle force at smaller muscle csa.
iv. discussion in this work, we developed a kinetic model combining the intracellular mechanosensor of the 2nd kind, the signalling chain pathway admittedly one of several, and the ribosomal kinetics of post-transcription synthesis to examine how mus- cles sense and respond to external load patterns by producing or degrading their contractile proteins 41.
the important factor of limitations to atp supply, which affects both the mvc level due to myosin activation and the signalling due to phosphorylation, is included in the background see fig. 3 and supplementary part a. the primary marker of morpho- logical response for us is the cross-section area csa of an average muscle bre, which is directly and linearly mapped onto the number of titin molecules per bre.
we suggest that the titin kinase tk domain has the right characteristics to play the role of the primary mechanosensor within the muscle cell. by looking at how tk unfolds under force, we found that it acts as a metastable switch, by opening rapidly only at high forces, but opening and closing slowly within a range of phys- iological forces.
the muscle is known to apply a low-level tensile force, and be under a steady-state passive tension at rest, which we compare with the steady-state force predicted by our model. we nd that the two forces are of the same mag- nitude, which suggests that long-term muscle stability is due a combination of the active muscle tone and the passive muscle load stored in elastic sarcomere proteins notably titin.
we nd that small changes in the steady-state force allow the mus- cle to maintain its size after the end of a resistance training programme, and we suggest that this change in steady-state muscle tension might account for some of the memory that muscle develops after long-term training 78, 79.
given the switch-like nature of tk, it seems likely that different individuals will have slightly different predisposi- tions towards applying somewhat more or less muscle tone in homeostasis, and therefore can maintain muscle mass much more or much less easily. this low-level steady-state tensile force will crucially depend on the number of available myosin heads and on the steady-state atp concentration in the cell, as well as sarcomere and tendon stiffness.
our model shows qualitatively reasonable time courses for hypertrophy, developing during a regular exercise regime, fol- lowed by detraining as well a muscle atrophy followed by recovery.
although it is not explicitly included in the cur- rent model, long-term changes in muscle lament architec- ture slightly increasing the muscle tone with the same csa, as well as increases in myonuclear number after chronic hy- pertrophy increasing the synthesis rates in the model, could cooperate to increase the steady-state muscle csa. this could then provide a rationale for the observed permanent increase 12 in muscle size after just one bout of resistance training in the past 84.
the model uses no free-tting parameters, since all its constants are independently measurable indeed, table i gives examples of such measurements. obviously, there would be a large individual variation between these parameter values, and so applying the quantitative model predictions to an individual is probably optimistic.
however, we are excited to develop a software to implement the model and make spe- cic predictions in response to any chosen exercise regime, which could be used and adapted to practitioners. we saw that a successive integration of the initial mechan- ical signal is necessary in order for muscle cells to display trophic responses at the right time scales.
indeed, a several- week lag is observed in the increase of structural proteins con- tent after the start of an exercise regime; in our model, this arises due to a lag in ribosome number, because ribosome turnover and synthesis is relatively slow. research into the sterically hindered diffusion of ribosomes in muscles so far appears to be very much in its infancy, despite its obvious overarching implications in muscle development. this would be an exciting avenue for future research in this area.
to further improve the model, we could include more de- tails about the viscoelastic properties of muscle. its effects would be twofold: rst, the switching kinetics between the titin kinase conformations would change somewhat see sup- plementary part e.2 for more details; secondly, it would al- low for a treatment of how muscle fatigue affects the com- pliance and therefore the mechanosensitivity of the mus- cles structural proteins.
we expect the plateauing of the mechanosensitive efciency at high forces explored in sup- plementary part a.4 in particular see fig. s4 in the sup- plementary to be even more pronounced. in fact, because the sarcomere structural proteins likely change their mechanosen- sitive properties at high forces, we expect there to be an opti- mal force at which the exercise should be carried out.
how- ever, this would substantially increase the mathematical com- plexity of the model, reducing its present intuitive clarity, and make an analytical solution for homeostasis less tractable. this is the next stage of model development that we hope to pursue.
in summary: how intracellular signaling in muscle cells or- ganises a trophic response is a central question in exercise science and in the study of conditions, which affect muscle homeostasis including development and ageing, as well as numerous pathologies. cells have been shown to use time- integrated mechanical stimuli to initiate signaling cascades, in a way which depends on the strength and duration of the signal i.e. mechanosensitively.
this work provides a quanti- tative analytical rationale for a mechanosensitive mechanism for trophic signaling in muscle, and gives an additional piece of evidence that the titin kinase domain is a good candidate for hypertrophic mechanosensing. we expect advances in tar- geted exercise medicine to be forthcoming, specically if the exact structure of the mechanosensing complex bound to the tk domain and its downstream signaling cascade are studied in more detail.

method: only randomized controlled trials rcts were included by searching relevant databases such as a web of science, pubmed, and ebsco, with search dates up to september 30, 2021. these trials performed resistance exercise training in overweight andor obese people, and outcome indicators included evaluation of body composition and muscle strength, among other relevant indicators.
the cochrane evaluation tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included literature, and statistical analysis was performed using the r analysis software. results: fifteen studies, 18 trials, with a total of 669 participants meeting eligibility criteria were included in the nal analysis, which included three resistance training types own body weight, resistance bands, and free weight.
the results showed that resistance bands improved body fat bf; smd 0.79, 95 ci 1.25 to 0.33, i2 0 in overweight or obese people better than other resistance training types. own body weight resistance training was better for increasing skeletal muscle mass in overweight or obese people smd 0.48, 95 ci 0.040.92, i2 0.
in addition, for muscle strength increase, although resistance exercise was shown to improve muscle strength, there was no signicant difference between the three exercise forms compared. conclusion: resistance bands can improve body composition by reducing bf. resistance bands can improve body composition by reducing bf, while it is more effective in increasing muscle mass and own body weight.
therefore, for overweight and obese people, resistance bands resistance exercise can be taken for fat loss, and resistance exercise for own body weight for further muscle gain and maintenance of muscle mass, so as to achieve the purpose of improving body composition. keywords: resistance exercise, body composition, overweight and obesity, muscle strength, forms liu et al.
different resistance exercise forms introduction nowadays, obesity has become one of the most important factors that endanger peoples health. especially in europe and the united states flegal et al., 2016, nearly one-third of the population is diagnosed as overweight or obese olds et al., 2010.
obesity can lead to a range of health problems, including the induction of cardiovascular diseases barrett-connor, 1985; aslibekyan and garvey, 2017, insulin resistance corts et al., 2020, and psychological disorders erermis et al., 2004. the most direct of these is that it causes a decrease in skeletal muscle contractile function bollinger, 2017; tallis et al., 2018, which leads to a decrease in skeletal muscle strength.
relevant studies have also shown that the relative muscle strength of overweight and obese people is signicantly lower than that of healthy people bollinger, 2017, which can lead to decreased physical function and even the occurrence of lifelong disability choi et al., 2016; eshima et al., 2017. therefore, improving body composition and increasing muscle strength in overweight and obese populations has become an urgent issue to be addressed.
usually, overweight andor obese people adopt aerobic exercise to reduce fat mass and, thus, improve body composition. however, often aerobic exercise reduces fat mass with a signicant decrease in muscle mass and muscle strength villareal et al., 2017. resistance training, as a representative of anaerobic training, can increase muscle strength by improving muscle performance and, thus, muscle strength.
moreover, the resistance exercise not only leads to a decrease in fat mass but also increases lean body mass, thus potentially making a person stronger in absolute terms shaibi et al., 2006; mcguigan et al., 2009. however, the eects of dierent resistance training forms may dier, and their eects on muscle strength and muscle mass are unclear. additionally, the improvement of body composition by resistance training is still unknown.
therefore, it is particularly important to explore the improvements in body composition and muscle strength with dierent resistance exercise forms. although several meta-analyses have summarized the eects of resistance training on muscle gain and fat loss orange et al., 2020, the studies have not specically investigated which resistance exercise forms are more eective in improving body composition and muscle strength, especially in overweight and obese people.
therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to systematically review and meta-analyze the eects of dierent forms of resistance training on body composition and muscle strength in overweight andor obese populations. additionally, to investigate suitable resistance exercise forms for overweight and obese populations to inform future personalized exercise prescriptions.
method search strategy databases, such as web of science, pubmed, ebsco, cnki, wanfang, and weipu, were searched through september 30, 2021. search terms included resistance training, strength training, resistance exercise, weight training, overweight, obesity, body weight, strength, power, and body compositions.
use the standard boolean operators and, or to concatenate search terms, e.g., pubmeds search formula is as follows: resistance training text word or strength training text wordor resistance exercise text wordor weight training text word and overweight text word or obesity text word or body weight text word and strength text word or power text word or body compositions text word, and track references for inclusion in the literature and related reviews.
inclusion criteria inclusion criteria followed the picos principles i.e., population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design: 1 all populations included in this study were overweight andor obese; 2 the intervention needed to include at least 4 weeks of exercise intervention and had to be resistance training; 3 the control group remained in the same condition as the study group, but without the exercise intervention; 4 outcomes needed to include: body mass index bmi, body fat bf, fat-free mass ffm, skeletal muscle content smc, and muscle strength ms; 5 the type of study was a randomized controlled trial rct; and 6 the mean and sd were reported in the trial.
exclusion criteria trials that met the following exclusion criteria were excluded: 1 meeting abstracts, case reports, reviews, overviews, and experimental animal studies; 2 the results did not meet the inclusion criteria; 3 study type was not an rct; and 4 mean and sd could not be obtained from the article or authors. studies selection two reviewers xl and jl independently reviewed the titles or abstracts of all studies.
a thorough and careful review of relevant studies was conducted to assess whether they could be included in the studies reviewed. any disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation with 89 a third author yg if necessary. quality assessment the cochrane collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included trials.
two reviewers qr and yj independently assessed the following seven areas of bias: random sequence generation selection bias, allocation concealment selection bias, blinding of participants and personnel performance bias, blinding of outcome assessment detection bias, incomplete outcome data attrition bias, and selective reporting reporting bias. three levels of high, low, or unclear bias were indicated for each study.
disagreements were resolved by discussion or consultation with a third independent reviewer xs, if necessary. data extraction two reviewers independently extracted the following data from each included eligible trial: study characteristics i.e., author and year, participant characteristics i.e., age and number of participants, and description and outcome of the intervention.
any disagreements were resolved through discussion to reach an frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org 2 february 2022 volume 12 article 791999 liu et al. different resistance exercise forms agreement, and the authors of the trials were contacted directly to obtain the original studies and data when necessary. statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using r rstudio v4.19, boston, ma, usa and meta-packages.
the percentage change between studies indicating heterogeneity was reported using the i2 statistic and the chi-square test. interpretation of the i2 statistic was by the cochrane guidelines as follows: low heterogeneity is assumed when i2 25, moderate heterogeneity is assumed when i2 75 and 25, and high heterogeneity is assumed when i2 75 higgins et al., 2003. evidence of heterogeneity is indicated by statistically signicant eects based on the chi-square test.

although all three modalities were eective in increasing muscle strength, no signicant dierences were found between groups by the subgroup analysis. discussion this review pooled rcts, 15 studies, and 18 trials with a total of 669 participants in a meta-analysis to assess the eects of dierent forms of resistance exercise on improving body composition and strength in overweight andor obese people.
by comparing dierent forms of resistance exercise, we found that resistance bands have the best eect on fat loss for overweight and obese frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org 7 february 2022 volume 12 article 791999 liu et al. different resistance exercise forms figure 7 meta-analysis of effects of different resistance exercise forms on body fat bf of overweight andor obese individuals. people and a better eect on muscle gain for their own body weight.
in addition, own body weight had the best eect on increasing muscle strength in overweight andor obese people.
body composition body composition is related to various physiological and pathological states, and the determination of body composition usually includes multiple indicators mller et al., 2012, and the evaluation of obesity should not be determined by bmi values alone but should include bf, ffm, and smc bosy-westphal and mller, 2021, thus, its more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of its body composition.
this review showed that the eect of resistance training on their bmi values and ffm was not signicant, which is generally consistent with previous studies schranz et al., 2013. we found by the subgroup analysis of resistance exercise with dierent forms that own body weight and free weights did not signicantly improve bmi values, bf percentage, and ffm, and free weights and resistance bands did not signicantly improve smc.
in contrast to previous studies, we found that resistance bands signicantly improved bmi, although there was no signicant dierence between groups, and for overweight and obese people, resistance bands signicantly reduced bf in overweight and obese people, and resistance bands can signicantly reduce the bf value to achieve fat loss.
this may be due to the special structure of resistance bands; the tensile force will gradually increase with its elongation, so the intensity of resistance training is not high, and the body mainly uses the aerobic oxidation of sugar and fat frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org 8 february 2022 volume 12 article 791999 liu et al. different resistance exercise forms figure 8 meta-analysis of effects of different resistance exercise forms on ffm of overweight andor obese individuals.
for energy supply, which can be very high to achieve the purpose of fat loss astorino, 2000; stisen et al., 2006. and compared with other forms of resistance exercise, resistance bands can change the direction of resistance at will, the user can basically train most of the muscles of the body in any position and posture, so it can be very good to achieve the purpose of fat burning.
but because of its resistance training intensity is not high, can not cause further stimulation of the muscle, so the eect of resistance bands on muscle gain is not ideal. furthermore, own body weight, as the only form of resistance exercise, can signicantly increase muscle mass. for overweight and obese people, they are heavier, so the intensity of resistance bands is sucient to stimulate the muscles and promote the thickening of muscle bers.
in addition, self-weight training can simultaneously allow our muscles to participate in the movement; rather than isolated muscle stimulation, this training is more comprehensive to increase all muscle groups, thus achieving the purpose of muscle building. this is a very exciting nding, as it has been previously reported that obesity reduces the eect of resistance exercise on improving body composition.
for example, a 6-month period of resistance exercise showed that resistance exercise was good for increasing strength but not statistically signicant for improving body composition schranz et al., 2014. in a subsequent study, it was also found that resistance exercise for 1 year did not improve body mass in obese people hintze et al., 2018.
so, the ndings of this study certainly break with the traditional aerobic exercise that has been the main means of weight loss fogelholm et al., 2000; villanova et al., 2006, especially for the overweight and obese population. after all, compared to aerobic exercise, resistance exercise can increase lean body mass and muscle mass in addition to reducing fat content garca-hermoso et al., 2018, thus better-improving body composition.
therefore, this nding undoubtedly provides strong support for resistance training as an eective way to combat obesity, lose fat, and gain muscle. since caloric restriction can improve body composition by accelerated loss of fat mass and blunted increase in ffm, it has been considered eective for weight loss in overweight and obese populations in previous studies astrup et al., 2004.
in this study, we performed the subgroup analysis with and without dietary intervention to better assess the eect of dierent forms of resistance exercise on body composition in overweight and frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org 9 february 2022 volume 12 article 791999 liu et al. different resistance exercise forms figure 9 meta-analysis of effects of different resistance exercise forms on smc of overweight andor obese individuals.
obese people 1.16 to 0.07, p 0.08, and ffm smd 0.94, 95 ci 0.33 to 2.21, p 0.65 were not signicantly improved. this reinforces the reference value of the dierences in the eects of dierent forms of resistance exercise on body composition in overweight and obese people. muscle strength muscle strength is one of the indicators that respond to a persons functional capacity barbat-artigas et al., 2014.
lower muscle strength leads to reduced physical mobility and increased risk of falls and fractures, especially in the aging population visser et al., 2005; newman et al., 2006. the muscle strengths incorporated in this study are all absolute strengths, which are particularly important for grasping the intensity of exercise and reducing the occurrence of sports injuries.
there should be no doubt that resistance exercise increases muscle mass peterson and gordon, 2011; candow et al., 2012 and muscle strength peterson et al., 2010; larsson et al., 2015, and this is equally supported by the literature on obese and overweight population avila et al., 2010; cunha et al., 2018.
current studies have mainly shown that resistance exercise increases muscle mass and strength by increasing the expression of relevant skeletal muscle synthesis proteins and decreasing catabolic levels dreyer et al., 2010; peterson et al., 2010; agergaard et al., 2017.
in this study, by comparing the three forms of resistance exercises, it was found that there was no signicant dierence between the three exercise forms for strength improvement, but the resistance bands showed a better trend for muscle strength improvement compared to the other two forms, and the subgroup analysis showed low heterogeneity, which can also better indicate that the data are more stable and reliable. the reliability of the data was high.
due to the specic structure of resistance bands, the tensile force increases gradually with their elongation, leading to changes in the muscle itself muscle ber type, muscle structure, myolament density, structure of connective tissue, and tendons and an increase in muscle nerve adaptation.
in particular, the results of this article show that the magnitude of the eect of resistance exercise on ms appears to be greater than that on smc in overweight or obese people, implying that the eect of resistance exercise on muscle neural recruitment andor muscle contractile function is greater than the eect on ber thickening.
therefore, for overweight and obese people, there may be a decrease in muscle anabolism, and the mechanism for increasing muscle strength is likely to be mainly resistance exercise that increases muscle neural recruitment andor muscle contractile function. compared to own body weight and free weights, the intensity of resistance training can be customized and optimized, and it is more functional, usually with the frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org

additionally, because overweight and obese people are heavier, the pressure on the joints is greater than that of healthy people, so resistance training with free weights and own body weight will undoubtedly increase the pressure on the joints, which will easily cause damage to the joints and is not suitable for overweight and obese people.
in addition, resistance bands, unlike other resistance training forms, are not controlled by the training site and are very light to practice, so they will greatly benet the health of all people.
strength and limitations this review is the rst to examine the eects of dierent forms of resistance exercise on body composition and muscle strength in overweight andor obese populations with outcome measures including bmi, bf, ffm, smc, and ms. in addition, the evidence from rcts will be more rigorous and objective than that from case studies.
compared to previous studies, this study includes dierent forms of resistance training to evaluate which resistance training forms can better improve body composition and strength, thus making training more precise and a signicant contribution to personalized exercise prescription. additionally, this review is a meta-analysis, which improves the statistical power of the article, provides more precise data, and addresses the reasons for conicting results between dierent experimental studies.
although the studies included in this review may not be typical of resistance exercise to assess changes in body composition and strength in dierent forms in obese populations, they provide a benchmark. it is suggested that the eects of resistance exercise on body composition and strength are benecial and that dierent forms of resistance exercise can be used to achieve dierent eects fat loss, muscle gain, strength gain, etc., especially in overweight and obese populations.
in terms of overweight and obese people, choosing resistance bands for fat loss and resistance exercise for their own body weight to increase muscle mass and increase muscle strength would be the best choice.
although the subgroup analysis of the factors that may inuence the results of this study caloric restriction, exercise volume, etc. did not signicantly interfere with the results of the experiment, however, due to the small number of studies available, especially for the subgroup analysis, the included literature is more limited and single, which may be limiting.
in addition, the age of the subjects in their own body weight was 12, the age of the subjects in the free weights was 13, and the age of the subjects in the resistance bands was 20. the subjects in the resistance bands were indeed slightly older, but overall, the age range of the subjects frontiers in physiology www.frontiersin.org 11 february 2022 volume 12 article 791999 liu et al. different resistance exercise forms included in all three training modalities was wide.
due to the limitations of the included literature, the variable of age was not taken into account in this paper; therefore, future studies on dierent resistance exercise forms should be increased, especially for overweight and obese people for dierent age groups, and studies combining dietary interventions and resistance training should be increased in order to better inform future personalized exercise prescriptions.
conclusion this systematic review and meta-analysis show that dierent forms of resistance exercise have dierent eects on overweight and obese individuals. resistance bands can improve body composition by decreasing bf. resistance bands can improve body composition by decreasing bf but are more eective at increasing muscle mass and own body weight.
therefore, for overweight and obese people, resistance bands can be used to lose fat, while resistance weights can be used to gain muscle and maintain muscle mass, thus improving body composition. however, given the limitations outlined in this study, it is necessary to take the results with a grain of salt. more rcts with large sample sizes are needed to better understand the eectiveness of dierent forms of resistance exercise interventions on body composition and muscle strength.

doi: 10.3389fspor.2022.949021 resistance training variables for optimization of muscle hypertrophy: an umbrella review roberto bernrdez-vzquez 1, javier raya-gonzlez 1, daniel castillo 2 and marco beato 3,4 1 faculty of health sciences, universidad isabel i, burgos, spain, 2 valoracin del rendimiento deportivo, actividad fsica y salud, y lesiones deportivas redafled, universidad de valladolid, soria, spain, 3 school of health and sports science, university of suffolk, ipswich, united kingdom, 4 institute of health and wellbeing, university of suffolk, ipswich, united kingdom this umbrella review aimed to analyze the different variables of resistance training and their effect on hypertrophy, and to provide practical recommendations for the prescription of resistance training programs to maximize hypertrophy responses.
a systematic research was conducted through of pubmedmedline, sportdiscus and web of science following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement guidelines. a total of 52 meta-analyses were found, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. these studies were published between 2009 and 2020 and comprised 178 primary studies corresponding to 4,784 participants.
following a methodological quality analysis, nine meta-analyses were categorized as high quality, presenting values of 8188. the remaining meta-analyses were rated as moderate quality, with values between 6375. based on this umbrella review, we can state that at least 10 sets per week per muscle group is optimal, that eccentric contractions seem important, very slow repetitions 10 s should be avoided, and that blood ow restriction might be benecial for some individuals.
in addition, other variables as, exercise order, time of the day and type of periodization appear not to directly inuence the magnitude of muscle mass gains. these ndings provide valuable information for the design and conguration of the resistance training program with the aim of optimizing muscle hypertrophy.
keywords: muscle mass, cross sectional area, load magnitude, training methods, resistance introduction hypertrophy is dened as an increase in muscular size, which can be achieved through exercise. two main factors contribute to this physiological phenomenon such as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy i.e., increased muscle glycogen storage and myobrillar hypertrophy i.e., increased myobril size and myobrillar number triplett and ha, 2015.
in this regard, resistance training is considered the gold standard for increasing muscle mass, which is based on three key variables such as mechanical stress, metabolic stress, and muscle damage ahtiainen et al., 2003.
traditionally, resistance training focused on hypertrophy is characterized by moderate load, high total volume load and short rest periods kraemer and ratamess, 2005, although the eects of resistance programs vary depending on the manipulation of its variables schoenfeld and grgic, 2017.
since promising eects related to the increase of muscular size on both performance and health have been previously reported maestroni et al., 2020, it seems justied to search for the most eective methods to generate hypertrophy.
bernrdez-vzquez et al. hypertrophy in healthy adults due to the strong positive relationship observed between the muscles capacity to generate force and their cross-sectional area csa maughan et al., 1983, hypertrophy is one of the main goals pursued by both professional and recreational athletes. thus, several research studies have analyzed the eects of resistance training on hypertrophy and its subsequent force level hornsby et al., 2018.
however, it is important to highlight that most team sports require high-force level, but also that the athletes must apply it in the minimum time period taber et al., 2016. regarding this, increasing muscle mass include a positive inuence on rate of force development and power, which improve sportive actions such sprinting, jumping, and change of direction ability keiner et al., 2014; seitz et al., 2014; suchomel et al., 2018.
in addition, muscle mass is a key factor in sports disciplines where the quality and quantity of muscle development is judged, such as bodybuilding schoenfeld, 2010. therefore, promoting hypertrophy could be a relevant strategy for improving sports performance andersen et al., 2000.
from a human health standpoint, muscle mass plays a signicant role in several actions of daily life as locomotion mcleod et al., 2016, so low levels of muscle mass may lead to an increased risk of several diseases maestroni et al., 2020.
in this regard, resistance training and their associated hypertrophy adaptations have been shown to have health benets such as reducing body fat, increasing metabolic rate, lowering blood pressure and cardiovascular demands on exercise, improving blood lipid prole, glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, a reduction in the risk of suering from type ii diabetes, an improvement in mobility and functional capacity, an increase in strength, muscle and bone mass, and an increase in related factors with quality of life wolfe, 2006; maestroni et al., 2020.
specically, balachandran et al. 2014 applied a hypertrophy-oriented resistance program 3 sets of 1012 repetitions using 70 of their one-repetition maximum and 1 2 min recovery with sarcopenic obese adults during 15 weeks obtaining improvements in functional capability and power, as well as a reduction in fat mass.
on the other hand, kadoglou et al. 2012 observed signicant improvements in glycemic control, insulin sensitivity and triglycerides after the application of a hypertrophy training program 23 sets of 810 repetitions using 6080 of the one-repetition maximum and 12 min recovery in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. for all these aforementioned benets, a comprehensive and controlled increase in muscle mass seems to be recommended for anyone, regardless of their age or tness level.
muscle hypertrophy adaptations can be obtained through several resistance training programs lixandro et al., 2015; radaelli et al., 2015; fink et al., 2016. however, there is no well-established consensus on how resistance training variables should be manipulated to optimize muscle growth, so an umbrella review on this topic is necessary.
an umbrella review is characterized by a unique criterion for the selection of scientic evidence, which only considers for inclusion the higher standard of evidence such as systematic reviews and meta- analyses aromataris et al., 2015. this approach oers the opportunity to compare and discuss ndings of dierent review papersthat can be summarized in a single review.
thus, the aims of this review were, rstly, to analyze the current and high-quality scientic literature i.e., meta-analysis on the manipulation of dierent variables of resistance training and their eect on hypertrophy responses, and, secondly, to provide practical recommendations for the prescription of resistance training programs to maximize hypertrophy responses.
methods umbrella review design the present umbrella review was carried out following the guidelines set forth by the working group of aromataris et al. 2015 and followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis prisma statement guidelines page et al., 2021. search strategy for this research, the following database were included: pubmedmedline, sportdiscus and web of science. likewise, researchgate was used as a source of complementary information.
the search syntax included the following keywords coupled with boolean operators: meta-analysis and resistance training or resistance exercise or strength training or strength exercise or strengthening exercise or weight lifting or weight training or blood ow restriction or blood-ow restricted or blood ow restricted or blood restriction or bfr or hypoxia or muscle actions and hypertrophy or muscles or csa or cross sectional area or cross-sectional area or growth or muscle size or muscle thickness or lean body mass or lbm or fat free mass or fat-free mass or skeletal muscle or muscle bers or bodybuilding or body building or muscle gain or muscular volume or body composition or muscular adaptations or hypertrophic eects and volume or frequency or frequencies or sets or multiple or single or tempo or velocity or speed or duration or repetitions or order or split training or total body training or split routine or split weight training or training or light or low or low- or high- and load or low-load or high-load or intensity or eccentric or concentric or shortening or lengthening or contraction mode or time-of-day or time of day or diurnal uctuations or circadian variation or circadian rhythms or program or programs.
a secondary search was performed based on the screening of the reference lists of the selected meta-analyses. the last and denitive search was conducted on 27th november 2021. two authors rbv and jr independently screened the title and abstract of each reference to locate potentially relevant studies and reviewed them in detail to identify articles that met the inclusion criteria.
any discrepancies between the authors in the selection process were solved in consultation with a third reviewer dc. inclusion criteria meta-analyses published in english whose aim was to analyze the eect of manipulating dierent variables of resistance training in muscle hypertrophy adaptations were included in this umbrella frontiers in sports and active living www.frontiersin.org 2 july 2022 volume 4 article 949021 bernrdez-vzquez et al. hypertrophy in healthy adults review.
following to the participant-intervention-comparison- outcome pico process for evidence-based practice schardt et al., 2007, the subsequent inclusion criteria were applied: a participants: male andor female healthy and physically active practitioners. studies focused on specic age-populations as children or elderly participants were excluded. b interventions: resistance training programs with traditional materials i.e., free weights and weight stack machines.
c comparison group: usual training no additional training. d outcome measures: muscle mass, csa, lean body mass, muscle girth, muscle thickness, fat-free mass, muscle bers and muscle volume. methodological quality analysis the methodological quality of the included meta-analyses was assessed through the assessing the methodological quality of systematic reviews 2 amstar 2 checklist, which is considered as a reliable and valid tool to evaluate the risk of bias shea et al., 2017.
amstar 2 is composed by 16 dierent items, which were answered with a yes, no, cannot answer or not applicable and only positive answers i.e., yes allow to sum 1 point. meta-analyses were classied as high quality at least 80 of the items were satised, moderate quality between 40 and 80 of the items were satised or low quality 40 of the items were satised attending to the obtained score in the amstar 2 checklist.
quality of the evidence evaluation the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the modied grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation grade principles guyatt et al., 2011.
in this sense, systematic reviews were classied as high i.e., at least two high-quality primary studies, moderate i.e., at least one high quality primary study or at least two moderate-quality primary studies, low i.e., only moderate-quality primary studies andor inconsistent results in the primary studies or very low i.e., no medium to high quality systematic review identied on this topic.
if the quality of the primary studies was not assessed, the systematic review must be classied as no evidence from systematic review.
study coding and data extraction the following moderator variables were extracted from the included reviews: a authors and year of publication, b resistance training variable analyzed, c main aim of the meta-analysis, d number of studiesparticipants included in the meta-analysis, e mean interventions duration, f heterogeneity among primary studies i2, and g main ndings or conclusions reported by the authors.
data extraction, methodological quality assessment and quality of the evidence evaluation were performed independently by two authors rbv and jrg and discrepancies between the authors were resolved in consultation with a third reviewer dc. results search results figure 1 shows the ow diagram of the meta-analyses retrieval process followed in this umbrella review. the initial search identied 55 meta-analyses, while 2 additional meta-analyses were found through the secondary search.
subsequently, 25 duplicate records were removed, and 13 meta-analyses were excluded based on their titles andor abstracts. nineteen meta- analyses were read in more detail i.e., full-text and 14 meta- analyses were included in the umbrella review roig et al., 2009; krieger, 2010; schoenfeld et al., 2015, 2016a, 2017a,b,c, 2019a; slysz et al., 2016; grgic et al., 2017, 2019; lixandro et al., 2018; grgic, 2020; nunes et al., 2020.
descriptive characteristics of the umbrella review the included meta-analyses are summarized in table 1. these studies were published between 2009 and 2020 and comprised 178 primary studies corresponding to 4,704 participants.
the 14 selected meta-analyses were classied attending to the analyzed variable, dierentiating between volume krieger, 2010; schoenfeld et al., 2017a, frequency schoenfeld et al., 2019a, intensity schoenfeld et al., 2016a, 2017c; grgic, 2020, contraction type roig et al., 2009; schoenfeld et al., 2017b, repetition duration schoenfeld et al., 2015, exercises order nunes et al., 2020, time of day grgic et al., 2019, periodization followed grgic et al., 2017 and blood-ow restriction slysz et al., 2016; lixandro et al., 2018.
methodological quality assessment and quality of the evidence evaluation the methodological quality of the 14 included meta-analyses is presented in table 2. nine meta-analyses were categorized as high quality, presenting values of 81 and 88 i.e., 13 items satised schoenfeld et al., 2015, 2017a,b, 2019a; grgic et al., 2017, 2019; lixandro et al., 2018; nunes et al., 2020.
the remaining meta-analyses were rated as moderate quality, with values between 63 and 75 i.e., from 10 to 12 items satised roig et al., 2009; krieger, 2010; schoenfeld et al., 2016a, 2017c; slysz et al., 2016; grgic, 2020.
according to grade, 8 meta- analyses were based on high-quality primary studies i.e., high grade roig et al., 2009; slysz et al., 2016; grgic et al., 2017, 2019; schoenfeld et al., 2017c; lixandro et al., 2018; grgic, 2020; nunes et al., 2020 while the other 7 meta-analyses did not presented information regarding to quality krieger, 2010; schoenfeld et al., 2015, 2016a, 2017a,b, 2019a.
discussion the main aims of this review were, rstly, to analyze the dierent variables of resistance training and their eect on hypertrophy responses, and secondly, to provide practical recommendations for the prescription of resistance training programs to maximize hypertrophy responses.
based on the 14 meta-analyses and the 178 primary studies included in our umbrella review, we can conclude that the variables of volume, frontiers in sports and active living www.frontiersin.org 3 july 2022 volume 4 article 949021 bernrdez-vzquez et al. hypertrophy in healthy adults figure 1 flow diagram of the study retrieval process.
frequency, intensity, contraction type, repetition duration, and the application of the restriction of blood ow can generate hypertrophy adaptations in healthy subjects. conversely, other variables such as exercise order, time of the day and type of periodization appear not to directly inuence the magnitude of muscle mass gains, however further research is necessary to clarify their capability to stimulate hypertrophy.
the ndings reported in this umbrella review provide valuable information for the design and conguration of resistance training programs aiming at optimizing muscle hypertrophy.
sets volume is commonly dened as the total amount of work performed schoenfeld and grgic, 2017 and can be expressed as the total number of setsrepetition per exercise wernbom et al., 2007; schoenfeld et al., 2017a or the total number of repetitions multiplied by the amount of weight used in an exercise across sets schoenfeld et al., 2016b.
this variable has received a great deal of attention with respect to enhancing muscle hypertrophy schoenfeld and grgic, 2017, since it has been traditionally assumed that prescribing high-volume during resistance training programs will produce greater gains in muscle mass mccall et al., 1999.
this statement is supported by the fact that, when the rest of the variables remain constant, increases in volume will necessarily increase the overall time-under-tension, which has been proposed as an important driver of anabolism burd et al., 2012.
however, it is still not clear if there is a real dose-response relationship for this variable and if there is a cut-opoint from frontiers in sports and active living www.frontiersin.org 4 july 2022 volume 4 article 949021 bernrdez-vzquez et al. hypertrophy in healthy adults table 1 summary of meta-analyses that investigated the effects of modify resistance training variables on hypertrophy.

when engaging in rt, practitioners often emphasize the importance of appropriate exercise technique, especially when trying to maximize training adaptations e.g., hypertrophy. this narrative review aims to synthesize existing evidence on what constitutes proper rt exercise technique for maximizing muscle hypertrophy, focusing on variables such as exercise-specific kinematics, contraction type, repetition tempo, and range of motion rom.
we recommend that when trying to maximize hypertrophy, one should employ a rom that emphasizes training at long muscle lengths while also employing a repetition tempo between 2 and 8 s. more research is needed to determine whether manipulating the duration of either the eccentric or concentric phase further enhances hypertrophy. guidelines for body positioning and movement patterns are generally based on implied theory from applied anatomy and biomechanics.
however, existing research on the impact of manipulating these aspects of exercise technique and their effect on hypertrophy is limited; it is therefore suggested that universal exercise-specific kinematic guidelines are followed and adopted in accordance with the above recommendations. future research should investigate the impact of stricter versus more lenient exercise technique variations on hypertrophy. keywords: resistance training form; muscle development; muscle growth 1.
introduction regimented resistance training rt has been shown to promote increases in muscle size also known as hypertrophy 1. maximizing muscle hypertrophy requires the manip- ulation of certain rt variables, such as training volume i.e., sets performed per muscle group per week, intensity of effort i.e., proximity to momentary muscular failure, and range of motion rom 2. training technique is another variable often referred to as a key component of effective rt.
the term training technique is often used to describe the different variables that make up an exercise, and it has been proposed that proper technique may enhance muscle development 3. currently, there is no universally agreed-upon definition in the scientific literature as to what constitutes proper technique and its constituent components.
the national strength and conditioning association nsca exercise technique manual 4 describes exercise technique components as a checklist that includes the following variables: primary muscle groups involved, correct grip widthorientation, stance, body position, and rom.
however, it is worth noting that what constitutes appropriate technique can be heavily affected by an individuals specific training goals, with different goals potentially requiring a specific technique to maximize adaptations e.g., hypertrophy versus power training 5. thus, from a muscle hypertrophy standpoint, we suggest the following definition: j. funct. morphol. kinesiol. 2024, 9, 9. https:doi.org10.3390jfmk9010009 https:www.mdpi.comjournaljfmk j. funct. morphol. kinesiol.
2024, 9, 9 2 of 9 resistance training exercise technique pertains to the controlled execution of bodily movements to ensure an exercise effectively targets specific muscle groups while minimiz- ing the risk of injury. this involves the orchestration of body positioning and alignment, rom, and repetition tempo.
when prescribing rt in both the literature and in practice, there is an emphasis on the importance of appropriate exercise technique to enhance the effectiveness of rt as well as to potentially prevent injury, although research directly exploring either outcome is scarce 6.
as it stands, guidelines for the prescription of exercise technique include exercise-specific body positioning, alignment, and rom recommendations, as well as universal tempo recommendations that vary depending on individual training goals. researchers have highlighted the importance of learning proper technique in the early stages of engaging in rt 7.
however, although it can be inferred that the authors are referring to some of the variables mentioned above, they do not explicitly define what constitutes proper technique, creating ambiguity in their recommendations. similarly, previous studies examining the manipulation of variables to maximize muscle hypertrophy often define proper form 8 as the guidelines outlined in the methods section of this study itself.
although one can extrapolate what constitutes optimal training technique by reading the literature on various variables comprising an rt exercise, no scholarly paper to date has endeavored to synthesize the current literature to develop guidelines for proper technique to maximize muscle hypertrophy, including studies that have specifically focused on the manipulation of different variables to maximize muscle hypertrophy 9,10.
therefore, this review aims to synthesize the evidence on what constitutes an optimal approach to training techniques for maximizing hypertrophy and provide recommendations for future research on the effect of the rt technique on muscle hypertrophy. 2. repetition tempo repetition tempo is one of the main components often mentioned when discussing exercise techniques to maximize hypertrophy.
the conventional rt technique usually involves the inclusion of combined eccentric and concentric actions during each repetition, and it has been proposed that both eccentric and concentric actions should be employed in order to maximize muscle hypertrophy 11. it is common for exercise professionals to emphasize the importance of either performing the concentric or eccentric phase of repetition with a specific duration 12.
some researchers have even proposed performing both actions in a super slow manner, but the benefits of this strategy on hypertrophy remain poorly supported in the literature, and some evidence indicates a detrimental effect of very slow tempos 13. a systematic review and meta-analysis by schoenfeld et al. 11 found that a wide range of repetition durations 0.5 to 8 s resulted in similar hypertrophy.
however, the authors noted that their review did not specifically analyze whether different eccentric and concentric tempo duration combinations could lead to different hypertrophic outcomes. notwithstanding, their findings did highlight that repetition tempo may not be as critical of a component for hypertrophy adaptations as previously hypothesized.
more recently, wilk et al. 14 reviewed the influence of tempo on hypertrophy and strength adaptations and found that a combination of slower eccentric and faster concentric repetition seems to be best for maximizing muscular development.
however, given the limited literature on the topic and the heterogeneity among the protocols of the studies re- viewed, the authors could not provide a specific tempo recommendation for each repetition phase and simply suggested a duration of 3 to 8 s per repetition. the recommendation by wilk et al. 14 for using a slower eccentric and faster con- centric tempo to maximize hypertrophy seems to stem mostly from the studies by keeler et al. 15 and nogueira et al. 16.
keeler et al. 15 found that when the duration of the eccentric phase was similar among conditions 5 vs. 4 s, prolonging the duration of the concentric phase 10 s did not increase lean body mass lbm when compared to a faster concentric phase 2 s. it is important to note that keeler et al. 15 did not directly measure j. funct. morphol. kinesiol.
2024, 9, 9 3 of 9 hypertrophy changes but rather assessed body composition changes via air displacement plethysmography bod pod; thus, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. addi- tionally, keeler et al. 15 noted that there were no significant pre-to-post lbm changes in either of the groups, specifically stating that the significant changes in strength and aerobic capacity were observed in the absence of changes in lbm.
in contrast, nogueira et al. 16 demonstrated that a faster concentric phase duration 1 s resulted in significantly greater biceps brachii and rectus femoris hypertrophy when compared to a slower concentric phase duration in a cohort of older men 3 s. some research indicates that extending the eccentric phase may enhance the rt- induced hypertrophic response.
pereira et al. 17 found that performing a 4 s eccentric elicited greater absolute biceps brachii hypertrophy when compared to a group performing a 1 s eccentric, with both groups employing a 1 s concentric repetition tempo. it should be noted that the findings of the study by pereira et al. 17 showed no statistically significant differences in hypertrophy between the two groups, but the effect sizes favored the group performing the extended eccentric phase.
a more recent study 18 looked at the effect of different eccentric repetition durations 2 vs. 4 s during repetitions that employed both concentric and eccentric actions on lower limb hypertrophy and strength and found that, although overall lower limb hypertrophy was similar, the group that performed longer eccentric repetitions experienced greater increases in vastus medialis muscle thickness.
contrastingly, pearson et al. 19 found that a 1 s eccentric resulted in marginally greater quadriceps muscle thickness increases compared to a 3 s eccentric in trained men perform- ing the leg extension. alternatively, shibata et al. 20 explored the effects of prolonging the eccentric phase during parallel squatting on hypertrophy and found no differences in thigh cross-sectional area changes between a 2 s-eccentric and a 4 s-eccentric group, with both groups employing a 2 s concentric tempo.
lastly, gillies et al. 21 compared a group performing all exercises using a 6 s eccentric and a 2 s concentric to a group performing all exercises using a 6 s concentric and 2 s eccentric. they found that the 6 s concentric group experienced significantly greater increases in vastus lateralis type i and iia fiber area, while the 6 s eccentric group experienced increases only in vastus lateralis type 1 fiber area.
the conflicting findings highlight the uncertainty on the topic and preclude the ability to draw strong conclusions for practical application. overall, it does indeed appear that significant increases in hypertrophy can occur with repetition durations between 2 and 8 s, allowing for a plethora of acceptable eccentric and concentric tempos.
based on the current literature, it is unclear whether extending the concentric or eccentric phase of a repetition will lead to greater hypertrophy, although it is advisable that eccentric actions be performed in a sufficiently controlled manner to ensure that the muscle controls the descent of the weight rather than relying solely on gravitational forces.
3. range of motion range of motion is defined as the degree of movement that occurs at a specific joint during the execution of an exercise 22. traditionally, a full rom, herein defined as the largest exercise-specific degree of rom that can be achieved at each joint, has been recommended for maximizing muscle hypertrophy 12. this recommendation is consistent with systematic reviews and meta-analyses that indicate a hypertrophic benefit to utilizing a full rom over a partial rom 23,24.
however, these papers dichotomized rom as either full or partial rom, without distinguishing the influence of muscle length. interestingly, some literature suggests the rom used may influence regional hypertrophy, with training at long muscle lengths eliciting more distal hypertrophy than training at short muscle lengths 25.
a more recent rom systematic review and meta-analysis by wolf et al. 22 found that a partial rom performed at longer muscle lengths was potentially superior to a full rom for hypertrophy. similarly, a systematic review by kassiano et al. 26 also found that a partial rom at long muscle lengths is sufficient to promote optimal muscle growth for muscles such as the quadriceps femoris, biceps brachii, and triceps brachii. that said, j. funct. morphol. kinesiol.
2024, 9, 9 4 of 9 caution must be taken when interpreting these results, as only three studies were included in the subgroup analysis by wolf et al. 22. since the publication of the wolf et al. 22 meta-analysis and the kassiano et al. 26 systematic review, two additional studies have compared longer-muscle-length partial rom to full rom training for hypertrophy.
kassiano et al. 27 assessed hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius when performing ankle plantarflexion rt with either a full rom, shorter- muscle length partial rom 50 of full rom, or longer-muscle length partial rom 50 of full rom. results showed that the medial gastrocnemius grew significantly more in the longer-muscle-length partial rom group than both the full rom and shorter-muscle-length partial rom groups.
alternatively, the lateral gastrocnemius grew significantly more in both the full rom and longer-muscle-length partial rom groups vs. the shorter-muscle- length partial rom group. overall, this study lends further credence to using longer- muscle-length partial rom to maximize muscle hypertrophy. an as-yet unpublished study comparing full rom to longer-muscle length partials has been presented as a conference abstract 28.
based on the abstract, hypertrophy of the hamstrings, gluteus maximus, and adductor muscles was compared when performing either full rom or longer-muscle-length partial rom 50 of full rom on the multi-hip machine. generally, hypertrophy was superior in the longer-muscle-length partial rom group, which saw significantly greater growth of the hip extensors as a composite and, more specifically, the gluteus maximus and long head of the biceps femoris.
the differences between the semitendinosus and semimembranosus were not significantly different, but effect sizes favored the partial rom group. it should be emphasized that this study methods have not been published, and thus the results must be interpreted cautiously. based on the current literature, it appears that utilizing a rom that biases longer mus- cle lengths should be the default approach to exercise technique when trying to maximize hypertrophy.
although traversing the end rom at shorter lengths may not promote an added benefit, and perhaps stopping degrees short could conceivably enhance hypertrophy via different mechanisms 29, more research on different rom configurations is needed to draw stronger conclusions on the topic.
additionally, the current literature on long-muscle- length training is limited to a few muscles, and thus more research is needed to understand whether some muscles may be more predisposed to longer-length training than others. 4. exercise-specific kinematics exercise-specific technique guidelines are meant to delineate the correct performance for a given exercise.
from a body positioning and movement pattern standpoint, the current guidelines are a product of years of technique refinement dating back to the exercises inception. the majority of rt exercises were not created based on scientific research that looked at different kinematic configurations of an exercise to find which configuration is better for optimizing hypertrophy or strength.
instead, rt exercise-specific guidelines specific to body positioning and movement patterns were based on a combination of extrapolation of applied anatomy concepts and biomechanical principles. exercise-specific instructions on body alignment and positioning grip width, foot positioning, bar placement intend to make an exercise biomechanically efficient, effective, and safe for the target muscles.
for example, the nsca exercise technique manual for resistance training 4 provides a detailed list of descriptions for performing the barbell back squat exercise correctly. guidelines include instructions like ensure the weight is evenly distributed between the heels and midfoot 4 when performing a barbell back squat to avoid falling, as well as muscle and joint-specific instructions on completing the exercise successfully e.g., extend the hips and knees fully.
the guidelines also highlight actions that must be avoided to adhere to the correct exercise technique e.g., do not allow the knees to shift inward or outward 4. although some of the exercise-specific guidelines are based on biomechanical rea- soning e.g., keeping the bar close to your body when performing a barbell deadlift to optimize the moment arms at the knee and hip joints, objective research directly exploring j. funct. morphol. kinesiol.
2024, 9, 9 5 of 9 the effect of different exercise-specific techniques on hypertrophy is limited. one of the very few direct studies on the topic explored the effect of altering foot position during calf training over a 9-week study period 30. this study found that training with different foot positions, i.e., foot pointed outward or inward, resulted in greater hypertrophy of different aspects of the calf muscles.
other studies have explored the effect of different foot positioning or grip width on muscle activation on exercises such as the machine leg press, lat pull-down, and barbell bench press 3133. however, given that muscle activation is not necessarily a good predictor of hypertrophy 34,35, the practical implications of these findings for exercise technique guidelines remain questionable.
additionally, previous literature has attempted to explore the biomechanics of specific exercises in an attempt to provide recommendations for manipulating different biomechan- ical components to optimize exercise performance and safety. schoenfeld 36 examined the kinematics and kinetics involved in squatting exercises and provided a list of practical recommendations pertaining to rom, squatting stance width, bar placement, etc.
it is im- portant to note that the recommendations provided in the review paper by schoenfeld 36 pertain mostly to squatting performance and safety and do not explore the potential in- fluence of biomechanical alterations on hypertrophy.
moreover, commonly emphasized technique guidelines pertaining to the reduction of injury risk when performing rt, such as associations between lumbar spine flexion and lower back pain, are often based on mechanistic evidence, including human and animal cadaver studies 37,38, rather than longitudinal or cross-sectional evidence in living humans 39. thus, conclusions from the studies must be interpreted cautiously.
when trying to optimize repetition technique, emphasis is often placed on the impor- tance of avoiding the involvement of ancillary muscle groups, especially on exercises meant to isolate a specific muscle. in practice, exercise technique is often categorized accordingly as strict or non-strict.
strict technique refers to an approach that effectively directs maxi- mum stimulation to the target muscle groups by minimizing the direct involvement of other muscle groups, while non-strict technique allows for the involvement of ancillary muscle groups.
for example, on a barbell biceps curl, the use of strict technique would involve a more upright posture with minimal hip and leg drive, while non-strict technique might involve a variable posture that sways back and forth, permitting assistance from the gluteals, erector spinae, and other muscles in addition to the biceps brachii. to the authors knowledge, only one previous study has attempted to explore the topic of strict versus non-strict techniques, albeit indirectly.
arandjelovic 40 employed mechanical modelingsimulation to explore the relationship between external momentum and muscular force in the lateral raise exercise to determine how muscular force may change when external momentum is supplied at the beginning of each repetition.
the author concluded that the use of a moderate amount of momentum at the beginning of each repetition in a set can allow for the use of heavier loads and thus a better overload of muscles in biomechanically advantageous positions, which conceivably could enhance muscular adaptations. conversely, more excessive amounts of momentum resulted in lower loading of the target muscles, thus potentially impairing the hypertrophic stimulus of an exercise.
however, given the current state of the literature in regard to the effect of rom on hypertrophy, it is possible that the use of moderate external momentum at the beginning of each repetition could potentially have deleterious effects by decreasing time spent at long muscle lengths on some exercises. alternatively, the use of external momentum may allow for more time spent training at long muscle lengths for other exercises e.g., bent over a barbell row, thus resulting in greater hypertrophy.
the findings of this simulation paper must be viewed with circumspection, given that it did not directly assess changes in muscle mass over time. as it stands, there is no literature directly examining the effect of strict versus non- strict repetition techniques on hypertrophy. while it could be argued that the involvement of other muscles may negatively affect the hypertrophic stimulus imposed on the target muscle, it is currently unclear whether that is truly the case.
although basing technique j. funct. morphol. kinesiol. 2024, 9, 9 6 of 9 guidelines on biomechanical principles has a logical basis, it remains unclear how strict the form needs to be to optimize hypertrophic outcomes while maintaining adequate safety standards. in the absence of direct evidence on the topic, it seems advisable to adopt current exercise-specific guidelines as they relate to body positioning and movement patterns.
moreover, differences in anthropometry between individuals will necessarily require some alteration in kinematics to facilitate safe and effective performance. further research is needed to provide greater clarity on the importance of strict body positioning and movement pattern recommendations for optimizing muscle hypertrophy.
5. practical recommendations based on the current available evidence, we recommend that exercise technique in rt programs designed to maximize muscle hypertrophy should employ a rom that allows a muscle to be fully stretched while utilizing an eccentric and concentric phase duration that spans an overall repetition duration of 28 s see table 1. this recommendation allows for a broad range of concentric and eccentric durations.
for example, a 1 s concentric and 2 s eccentric, a 4 s concentric and 4 s eccentric, or a 7 s concentric and 1 s eccentric would all technically fit within these guidelines. existing research on the impact of manipulating body position and movement patterns and their effect on hypertrophy is limited, and it is therefore suggested that universal exercise-specific kinematic guidelines be incorporated into the above recommendations. table 1. technique recommendations to maximize muscle hypertrophy.
variable evidence maximization recommendation tempo moderate a repetition tempo of 28 s seems to be sufficient to maximize hypertrophy, and it is currently unclear whether extending the concentric or eccentric phase of a repetition will lead to greater hypertrophy rom moderate employ a rom that allows for muscles to be fully stretched involvement of non-target muscles na diminish involvement by minimizing the use of external momentum when possible na, not applicable.
it is currently unclear as to whether a less strictlenient technique, via the introduction of movement generated by the involvement of unintended muscle groups, will yield inferior results to stricter repetitions that minimize the involvement of unwanted muscle groups, especially when the rom and tempo recommendations are followed.
as long as one can take the intended muscle group to momentary failure, the involvement of other muscle groups may not play a significant role in impairing muscle hypertrophy. however, it may be that if the other muscle groups involved are working primarily at short muscle lengths e.g., the hip extensors during a bicep curl, the fatigue generated by their involvement may not be worth the trade-off as they are unlikely to benefit from the stimulus provided.
indeed, they would be very far from reaching momentary failure, and partial repetitions at shorter-muscle lengths are not as hypertrophic as partial repetitions at longer-muscle lengths 22. notwithstanding, it is possible that the fatigue generated may be negligible without any meaningful impact on muscle recovery 41.
on the contrary, it could also be argued that if the assisting muscles are at longer muscle lengths e.g., the hip extensors during the bent over row, they may also experience increases in muscle hypertrophy since sets performed far from momentary failure e.g., j. funct. morphol. kinesiol. 2024, 9, 9 7 of 9 58 repetitions in reserve can also lead to hypertrophy increases 42.
however, given the paucity of data on the subject, it is recommended to minimize the involvement of other joints to ensure repetitions adhere to the recommended repetition tempo and rom. 6. conclusions the repetition technique to maximize muscle growth may be more flexible than previously thought, with the main variable of influence appearing to be rom, specifically emphasizing training at long muscle lengths.
given the current literature, eccentric and concentric repetition tempos can vary based on preference, as long as the total repetition length is between 2 and 8 s. future research should attempt to further explore the concept of what constitutes appropriate rt technique for maximizing hypertrophy and the different perceptions as well as practices that exist among exercise professionals, physique sport athletes, and coaches.
additionally, future research should also directly explore the effect of strict versus more lenient exercise techniques on hypertrophy, specifically focusing on whether the contribution of non-targeted muscle groups affects hypertrophy outcomes in exercises intended to target a specific muscle. author contributions: j.n. and p.a.k. conceived of the idea for this paper. p.a.k., m.w., m.c., r.b., a.p. and b.j.s. contributed to the writing and critical editing of this manuscript.
