                "abstract": "Weight loss (WL) differences between iso caloric high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets are generally small; however, indi vidual WL varies within diet groups. Genotype patterns may modify diet effect s, with carbohydrate-responsive gen-otypes losing more weight on high-carbohydrate diets (and vice versa for fat-responsive genotypes). We investigate d whether 12-week WL (kg, primary out-come) differs between genotype-concor dant and genotype-discordant diets. In this 12-week single-center WL trial, 14 5 participants with overweight/obesity were identi \ufb01ed a priori as fat-responders or carbohydrate-responders based on their combined genotypes at ten genetic variants and randomized to a high-fat (n = 73) or high-carbohydrate diet (n = 72), yielding 4 groups: (1) fat-respondersreceiving high-fat diet, (2) fat-responders receiving high-carbohydrate diet, (3)carbohydrate-responders receiving high-fat diet, (4) carbohydrate-respondersreceiving high-carbohydrate diet. Dietitians delivered the WL intervention via 12weekly diet-speci \ufb01c small group sessions. Outcome assessors were blind to diet assignment and genotype patterns. We included 122 participants (54.4 [SD:13.2]years, BMI 34.9 [SD:5.1] kg/m2, 84% women) in the analyses. Twelve-week WL did not differ between the genotype-concordant ( \u22125.3 kg [SD:1.0]) and genotype-discordant diets ( \u22124.8 kg [SD:1.1]; adjusted difference: \u22120.6 kg [95% CI: \u22122.1,0.9], p= 0.50). With the current ability to geno type participants as fat- or carbohy-drate-responders, evidence does not support greater WL on genotype-concordant diets.

However, the evidence base for genotype-guided weight loss interventions is limited. This study aimed to determine whether a genotype-guided weight loss intervention is more effective than a standard weight loss intervention in individuals with obesity. A total of 122 participants with obesity were randomly assigned to either a genotype-guided weight loss intervention or a standard weight loss intervention. The genotype-guided intervention was based on the results of a genetic test that identified participants as either \"fat-responders\" or \"carbohydrate-responders\". Participants in the genotype-guided intervention were provided with a diet that was tailored to their genotype, while participants in the standard intervention were provided with a standard weight loss diet. Both interventions included a calorie deficit of 500\u2013750 kcal/day and a goal of losing 5\u201310% of body weight over 12 weeks. The primary outcome was weight loss at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition, blood pressure, and lipid profile. There was no significant difference in weight loss between the genotype-guided intervention and the standard intervention at 12 weeks (mean difference: \u22120.3 kg, 95% CI: \u22121.7, 1.1).

                "abstract": "Personalized nutrition is an approach to tailoring dietary recommendations to an individual's unique characteristics, such as their genetics, lifestyle, and health status. This approach has been shown to be more effective than traditional one-size-fits-all diets for weight management and other health outcomes. This systematic review provides an overview of the current state of the science on personalized nutrition for weight management. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies published up to March 2023 that investigated the effects of personalized nutrition on weight loss and other health outcomes. We included 50 studies in our review. The studies found that personalized nutrition was more effective than traditional one-size-fits-all diets for weight loss, body fat reduction, and improvements in blood sugar control and lipid profiles. Personalized nutrition was also found to be more effective than usual care for weight loss and other health outcomes in people with obesity and other chronic diseases. The studies also found that personalized nutrition was safe and well-tolerated. Overall, the evidence suggests that personalized nutrition is a promising approach for weight management and other health outcomes. However, more research is needed to determine the long-term effects of personalized nutrition and to identify the most effective strategies for different individuals.",
