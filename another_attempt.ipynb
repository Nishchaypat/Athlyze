      "{'findings': ['Muscles sense internally generated and externally applied forces, responding to these in a coordinated hierarchical manner at different time scales.', 'The center of the basic unit of the muscle, the sarcomeric M-band, is perfectly placed to sense the different types of load to which the muscle is subjected.', 'The kinase domain (TK) of titin located at the M-band is a known candidate for mechanical signaling.', 'TK opens as a metastable mechanosensitive switch, which naturally produces a much greater signal after high-load resistance exercise than an equally energetically costly endurance effort.', 'The full model yields a steady-state solution (homeostasis) for muscle cross-sectional area and tension, and a quantitatively plausible hypertrophic response to training as well as atrophy following an extended reduction in tension.', 'The overall muscle is characterised by its cross-section area (CSA), which contains a certain number ( Nc) of mucle ﬁbers (the muscle cells with multiple nuclei, or multinucleate myocytes).', 'A given mus- cle has a nearly ﬁxed number of myocytes: between Nc 1000 for the tensor tympani, and Nc>1,000,000 for large muscles: gastroc- nemius, temporalis, etc. [1].', 'Muscle cells contain a variable num- ber ( Nm) of parallel myoﬁbrils (organelles), each of which can be divided into repeated mechanical elements called sarcomeres.', 'The typical length of a sarcomere is ca. 2 mm, so there are ca. 105of these elements in series along a ﬁber in a typical large muscle [2].', 'Each sarcomere contains a number of parallel thick ﬁlaments (heli- cal bundles of myosin, red) whose constituent myosins pull on the actin polymers in the thin ﬁlaments (F-actin, blue) to generate force.', 'Within the myoﬁbrils, the spacing between neighbouring myosin ﬁl- aments is ca. 0.046 mm at rest [3, 4].', 'The typical cross-sectional area of a single muscle ﬁbre substantially varies between individuals and muscle types, but is of the order of 4000 mm2[5].', 'Accounting for some 15% of the cell volume being outside of the myoﬁbrils [6], this means that a typical muscle ﬁbre has some ca. 2,000,000 paral- lel ﬁlaments across, between which the macroscopic force Fmust be divided.', 'Rather than using this awkward number, we will express our results in terms of the total myoﬁbrillar CSA within a single muscle ﬁbre.', 'A chemically activated muscle ﬁbre with a CSA of 4000 mm2 shows a force in the vicinity of 300-1000 mN for untrained individ- uals (with a very large individual variation) [7], which translates to an average ﬁlament force of 150-500pN (see Supplementary A.6).', 'Training can increase the neural activation level [8] as well as the number of active myosin heads and the maximum voluntary contrac- tion force per ﬁlament ( e.g. by stretch activation [9]).', 'Because of this, we would expect resistance training to lead the ﬁlament forces to tend towards the upper end of the range (  500pN).', 'During active muscle contraction, myosin heads (motors) bind to actin and ‘walk’ in an ATP-controlled sequence of steps [15] along the thin ﬁlaments.', 'When a resistance is ap- plied, the myosin motor exerts a force against it.', 'During slow resistance training in both concentric and eccentric motions, tension is passed along the sarcomere primarily through the thin ﬁlament, myosin heads [16, 17], the thick ﬁlament, and into the cross-bridge region of the sarcomere where thick ﬁla- ments are crosslinked with their associated M-band proteins.', 'The load in each of the sarcomere components ultimately depends on the relative compliance of elements.', 'The relative load on the thick ﬁlament and the M-band segments of titin when the ﬁlament is either under internal (contracting) or ex- ternal (extending) load is discussed in Supplementary A.4.', 'It is well-known that titin is under load when the sarcomere is extended [18, 19].', 'Recent X-ray diffraction experiments [20] suggest that that the thick ﬁlament may be more compliant than originally thought; if so, M-line titin is likely substan-', 'tially extended and loaded titin when the muscle actively gen- erates force.', 'Others disagree [21] and attribute the change in line spacing in diffusion experiments to a mechanosensitive activation of the entire thick ﬁlament at low forces.', 'Either way, M-band titin is under some tension during active muscle contraction.', 'This situation is sketched in Fig. 2.', 'We estimate the force in each ﬁlament both macroscopi- cally and microscopically (see the full discussion in Supple- mentary Part A.2 and A.3).', 'We divide the force in the entire muscle by the number of active myoﬁlaments (see Fig. 1) to ﬁnd a large variation in force per ﬁlament in untrained individ- uals (150 500pN) [7].', 'Muscle ﬁbre neuronal and molecular activation increases with training [8, 9], so the higher forces are more likely representative of ﬁlament forces in trained in- dividuals.', 'The maximum ﬁlament forces extrapolated from X-ray diffraction studies [22] are higher at  600pN, possi- bly because the actin only partially binds to myosin in normal contractions, maximum forces do not last very long, and be- cause the muscle does not coordinate perfectly as a whole.', 'In Supplementary Part A.4, we graphically ﬁnd an approximate relation between titin and thick ﬁlament force.', 'In particular, it suggests that the force per titin be close to 25pN at the maxi- mum voluntary contraction force.', 'In Section A.1 of the Supplementary Material, we discuss different candidates of mechanosensitive signaling in the sar- comere, and highlight the reasons why titin kinase is a par- ticularly good candidate for this role, and why we have not considered some of these other candidates here.', 'TK is a mechanosensor of the ‘second kind’', 'Cells sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their environment using two main classes of force receptors.', 'Mechanosensitive ion channels are rapidly depleted, making it difficult for these sensors to signal in response to a sustained force.', 'Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mechanosensor can sense substrate stiffness by measuring the tension in the integrin-talin-actin force chain.', 'FAK and the TK domain both open under force, can be phosphorylated, and appear pivotal to mechanosensitive signalling.', 'TK domain has been suggested to act as mechanosensor.', 'TK domain opens under force.', 'Phosphorylation can form the basis for signaling if an input changes the protein’s conformation, from a native folded conformation which cannot bind to a phosphate group to an ‘open’ conformation in which the geometry of the molecule allows phosphate groups to be donated to the phosphorylation site.', 'Protein unfolding under force has been analysed extensively, beginning with studies of the titin Ig domain.', 'Ig domains unfold under quite a high force and could initially appear to be candidates for mechanosensors.', 'Very few phosphorylation sites have been found on the Ig domains, compared with the remainder of the molecule, suggesting that they do not contribute to force-induced signaling.', 'Titin kinase was initially thought to be the only catalytic domain on titin.', 'TK acts as a pseudokinase, simply scaffolding the aggregation of a protein complex when it is phosphorylated, and allowing for another protein to be allosterically phosphorylated.', 'AFM experiments show that the presence of ATP changes the conformational energy landscape of the TK molecule as it is stretched.', 'TK molecule possesses a long-lasting open conformation of its TK domain, in which it can accommodate the recruitment of signaling molecules upstream of a mechanosensitive signaling pathway.', 'Titin interacts with an unsurprisingly large number of molecules.', 'Resistance training repetition can be modeled as a piecewise function for force.', 'Muscle training involves opening and phosphorylation of the TK domain.', \"The energy barrier for the transition between the 'closed' native domain conformation and the 'open' conformation which supports ATP-binding and phosphorylation is the key determinant of the kinetic transition rates between the two TK states.\", 'AFM data collected by Puchner et al. is essential for matching the relevant TK conformations to their data and explaining how to extract several important model parameters.', 'The phosphorylated TK domain can bind the zinc finger domain protein nbr1 and begin to form an aggregate; the concentration of the signaling complexes must be introduced with a new separate kinetic equation.', 'SRF, the mechanosensitive signaling molecule in the Lange model, is known to undergo activation by phosphorylation.', 'Assuming that the complete mechanosensing complex has a time-independent probability to disassemble, with a rate kdnsns, we estimate the corresponding rate constant kdns from experiments that show the increase in phospho-SRF (activated signal) after exercise.', 'The degradation rate of the mechanosensing complex occurs with a half-life of ca. 10 minutes.', 'Small changes in tension result in large changes to the signal concentration.', 'The concentration of signal (possibly SRF) can increase for a substantial time of the order of a couple of days, which could help account for the immediate increase in protein synthesis post-exercise.', 'Muscle takes at least a few of weeks to begin to show visible hypertrophic adaptations.', 'Three weeks of resistance training appears to be a consensus time, after which true hypertrophy is actually detected.', \"Ribosome biogenesis allows for 'time integration' of the signal.\", 'The inhibition of the diffusion of ribosomal subunits by the myofilament lattice could reduce the synthesis of new sarcomeric proteins by a sizeable amount (5  10%) in adult myocytes.', 'The hierarchical sarcomere structure is well-conserved in most muscles at rest.', 'Muscle force is determined by the energy barrier between closed and open conformations of the TK domain and the unfolding distance umax.', 'A small change in muscle steady-state force can maintain a large change in muscle size.', 'The force per titin during a contraction at the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) is estimated to be 25pN.', 'In the low-load regime, there is very little active muscle force (muscle tone), perhaps only 1-2% of the MVC force.', 'Passive tension at the optimal sarcomere length is of the order of 5-10% of the MVC force.', 'Resistance training increases the number of open TKs, which remain elevated for days after exercise.', 'TK signaling increases linearly with exercise duration, while opening rates increase exponentially with force in TK.', 'Mechanosensitive signaling is always more effective as the load increases until at least about 70% of the MVC force.', 'Doubling the force increases mechanosensitive signaling by several orders of magnitude.', 'Muscle training involving multiple sets of repetitions can lead to increased muscle size and strength.', 'The force per titin during exercise is an important factor in determining the training response.', 'ATP depletion during exercise can lead to fatigue and a decrease in the duration of repetitions.', 'The open state of titin is metastable at steady-state tension, allowing the muscle to produce a mechanosensitive signal long after the end of exercise.', 'Myofibrillar protein synthesis increases in the two days following resistance training.', 'The density of titins is approximately constant at 3000 per mm3 or 6000 per mm2.', 'The density of titins can be used to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA) of a muscle.', 'The actual exercise load to the whole muscle must increase proportionally to achieve optimal growth.', 'The energy barrier for TK opening (DG0) is around 30 kBT or 75 kJ/mol.', 'Maintaining the same exercise load while the CSA increases will result in a decrease in the effective force per titin.', 'Modifying the exercise by increasing the total load in proportion with CSA will result in a greater increase in CSA.', 'The final saturation of muscle growth is reached in about a year with a 30% increase in CSA in the non-adaptive case.', 'In the adaptive exercise case, the final saturation is reached much slower, but the total myofibrillar CSA increase is about 88%.', 'The regularity of exercise has a strong effect on the long-term magnitude of hypertrophy.', 'The extent of muscle hypertrophy is roughly linearly dependent on the exercise frequency.', 'There is a known lag between the start of an exercise regime and the detection of muscle hypertrophy.', 'Ribosomes may be the main factor limiting an increase in protein synthesis, and must be made more abundant before hypertrophy can occur.', 'Muscle growth during the exercise program and muscle detraining after exercise program ends are strongly dependent on the feedback from the slow diffusion of ribosomes.', 'High-intensity resistance exercise can lead to a 1% CSA change per week.', 'Strength-trained athletes respond less to resistance training regimes.', 'Muscle CSA slowly decreases after stopping a resistance training program, eventually returning to its pre-trained homeostatic value.', 'Detraining time courses range from two months for skeletal muscle to several years for hypertrophic cardiac muscle.', 'Career athletes maintain significantly higher muscle CSA long after retiring.', 'The body maintains a memory of prior resistance training events by changing its methylome.', 'Muscle size can rapidly decrease when the body is subjected to bed-rest, microgravity, famine, or certain pathologies.', 'Muscle is seen to recover relatively rapidly after substantial atrophy, with most of the recovery occurring over 1-2 weeks.', 'Muscle atrophy and recovery rates depend on the force feedback between muscle force and muscle cross-sectional area (CSA).', 'Negligible force feedback leads to unphysiologically slow rates of atrophy and recovery.', 'Higher force feedback leads to more reasonable recovery rates, which are closer to clinical observations.', 'A reasonable force feedback scale is a required feature of muscle models for quantitative predictions.', \"Muscle may exhibit an 'overshoot' during fast recovery after atrophy, suggesting that muscle retains a memory of its previous architecture.\", 'Titin kinase (TK) may play a role as the primary mechanosensor within muscle cells.', 'TK acts as a metastable switch, opening rapidly only at high forces, but opening and closing slowly within a range of physiological forces.', 'Muscle stability is due to a combination of active muscle tone and passive muscle load stored in elastic sarcomere proteins, notably titin.', 'Small changes in steady-state force allow the muscle to maintain its size after the end of a resistance training program.', 'Different individuals may have different predispositions towards applying more or less muscle tone in homeostasis, affecting their ability to maintain muscle mass.', 'Long-term changes in muscle filament architecture and increases in myonuclear number could contribute to permanent increases in muscle CSA.', 'Muscle cells display trophic responses at the right time scales due to a successive integration of the initial mechanical signal.', 'There is a several-week lag in the increase of structural proteins content after the start of an exercise regime due to a lag in ribosome number.', \"The viscoelastic properties of muscle affect the switching kinetics between the titin kinase conformations and the compliance of the muscle's structural proteins.\", 'There is an optimal force at which exercise should be carried out for maximum mechanosensitive efficiency.', 'Cells use time-integrated mechanical stimuli to initiate signaling cascades in a way that depends on the strength and duration of the signal.', 'The titin
