  "intro": "This nutrition plan is designed for Nishchay, focusing on maintaining a lean physique and supporting general fitness rather than maximizing muscle mass or strength. It emphasizes a balanced approach to nutrition, incorporating a variety of animal-based protein sources as per Nishchay's preference, while ensuring adequate carbohydrate and fat intake for energy and overall health. The plan is structured around moderate-intensity workouts and recreational activities, aligning with Nishchay's fitness goals and training frequency. It prioritizes sustainable dietary habits and mindful eating over rigid calorie counting to promote long-term adherence and avoid potential negative impacts associated with overly strict self-monitoring.",
  "diet_schedule": {
    "caloric_needs": {
      "daily_calories": "2700",
      "calculation_method": "Mifflin-St Jeor equation for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) multiplied by an activity factor of 1.55 (moderate activity level). BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5.  Weight = 165 lbs / 2.205 = 74.8 kg. Height = 5'8'' = 68 inches = 172.7 cm. BMR = (10 x 74.8) + (6.25 x 172.7) - (5 x 22) + 5 = 1775 kcal.  TDEE = BMR x 1.55 = 1775 x 1.55 = 2751 kcal. Rounded down to 2700 kcal for a maintenance level considering minimal muscle gain and fat maintenance goals.",
      "adjustment_factors": "Caloric intake can be adjusted by +/- 100-200 calories based on weekly weight fluctuations and energy levels. If weight consistently decreases and energy levels drop, increase calories slightly. If weight increases more than desired, reduce calories slightly. Adjustments should be made gradually and monitored over 1-2 week periods to assess trends."
    },
    "macronutrient_distribution": {
      "protein": "135g (20% of total calories). Rationale:  While Nishchay favors animal protein, his goals are not focused on muscle hypertrophy. A moderate protein intake of approximately 1.8g per kg of body weight (135g for 75kg) is sufficient to support muscle maintenance and general bodily functions without excessive emphasis on muscle growth, aligning with his 'muscle mass reduction' goal. This recommendation is based on research indicating that for general fitness and health, protein intake around 1.2-2.0g/kg is adequate, with the lower end suitable for those not prioritizing muscle gain.",
      "carbohydrates": "338g (50% of total calories). Rationale: Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for moderate-intensity workouts and recreational activities, which are central to Nishchay's fitness approach.  A higher carbohydrate intake supports sustained energy levels, glycogen replenishment, and overall performance in endurance-based activities. This aligns with general dietary guidelines recommending 45-65% of daily calories from carbohydrates, especially for active individuals.",
      "fats": "60g (30% of total calories). Rationale:  Fats are essential for hormonal balance, vitamin absorption, and overall health.  Including healthy fats supports long-term well-being and provides satiety.  30% of calories from fat is within the recommended range (20-35%) and supports general health without promoting excessive fat gain, consistent with Nishchay's 'fat maintenance or gain' goal. Focus on unsaturated fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil.",
      "explanation": "This macronutrient distribution is designed to support Nishchay's goals of maintaining a lean physique and general fitness while accommodating his dietary preferences. The moderate protein intake supports muscle maintenance without promoting significant hypertrophy. The higher carbohydrate intake fuels his active lifestyle and moderate-intensity workouts.  The moderate fat intake ensures hormonal balance and overall health. This balanced approach aligns with recommendations for general health and fitness, prioritizing sustainable dietary habits over extreme macronutrient ratios often associated with specific physique goals like maximal muscle gain or fat loss."
