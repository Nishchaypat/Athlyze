  "intro": "This personalized nutrition plan is designed for Nick, a 22-year-old intermediate lifter aiming to increase overall body strength, gain muscle definition in the abs, arms, and shoulders, and reduce fat in the arms and thighs. The plan is grounded in scientific evidence, focusing on sustainable dietary habits and progressive adjustments. It acknowledges personal preferences and lifestyle integration for optimal adherence and results. Feedback and self-monitoring will be incorporated mindfully to track progress and avoid rigid behaviors.",

      "adjustment_factors": "Calculated based on estimated Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using Mifflin-St Jeor equation, multiplied by an activity factor of 1.6 (for 6 days/week training). This provides a slight caloric surplus to support muscle growth while being mindful of fat loss goals. Caloric intake will be adjusted based on progress and body composition changes every 2-4 weeks."

      "explanation": "This macronutrient distribution is designed to support muscle protein synthesis, provide adequate energy for intense training, and maintain hormonal balance. \n\n**Protein (2.2g/kg):**  Sufficient protein intake is crucial for muscle hypertrophy and repair, especially during strength training. Research consistently supports higher protein intake for individuals aiming to build muscle mass.  \n\n**Carbohydrates (5g/kg):** Carbohydrates are the primary fuel source for high-intensity workouts. Adequate carbohydrate intake ensures sufficient glycogen stores for training and recovery, optimizing performance and muscle growth. \n\n**Fats (1.1g/kg):** Healthy fats are essential for hormone production, nutrient absorption, and overall health. They also provide sustained energy and contribute to satiety. Prioritize unsaturated fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil."
