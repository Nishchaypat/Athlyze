    "daily_water_intake": "Approximately 3 liters per day, adjusted based on activity levels and climate.",
    "timing_strategy": "Consume water consistently throughout the day. Increase intake during and after workouts.",
    "explanation": "Adequate hydration supports optimal physiological function, including nutrient transport, temperature regulation, and waste removal, crucial for overall fitness and well-being as per research on hydration and athletic performance."

  "adjustment_guidelines": {
    "weight_loss_plateau": "Increase daily activity levels or slightly reduce caloric intake by 100-200 calories while ensuring adequate protein intake to prevent muscle loss. Consult research on plateau management for detailed strategies.",
    "strength_plateau": "Incorporate progressive overload by gradually increasing training volume, intensity, or frequency. Ensure adequate protein intake (around 0.8g/lb body weight) to support muscle recovery and growth. Refer to research on strength training plateaus.",
    "energy_issues": "Evaluate sleep quality, stress levels, and overall caloric intake. Consider incorporating more nutrient-dense foods and complex carbohydrates for sustained energy release. Research on fatigue and nutrition can offer further guidance."

      "title": "Personalized Macronutrient Ratio",
      "description": "Given Nishchay's goals of minimal strength focus and fat maintenance or slight gain, a balanced macronutrient distribution of approximately 40% carbohydrates, 30% protein, and 30% fats is recommended.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research on personalized dietary advice indicates improved understanding of the link between diet and health outcomes. A balanced macronutrient profile supports overall health and well-being without emphasizing significant muscle growth or fat loss.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Track food intake using a food diary or app to monitor macronutrient intake. Adjust portion sizes as needed to achieve the desired ratio. Consult with a registered dietitian for personalized guidance if necessary."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emphasis on Whole, Unprocessed Foods",
      "description": "Prioritize nutrient-dense foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive saturated fats.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research indicates that whole, unprocessed foods provide a wider range of essential nutrients and contribute to better overall health compared to processed foods. This aligns with Nishchay's flexible dieting approach while ensuring nutritional adequacy.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Gradually replace processed foods with whole food alternatives. Focus on meal preparation and cooking at home to control ingredients and portion sizes."

      "title": "Mindful Eating Practices",
      "description": "Pay attention to hunger and fullness cues. Avoid rigid dietary tracking or calorie counting to prevent potential negative psychological effects, as highlighted by research on eating disorders and self-monitoring.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research suggests that rigid self-monitoring can be detrimental to mental health. Focusing on mindful eating promotes a healthier relationship with food and supports long-term sustainable habits.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Practice mindful eating techniques such as eating slowly, savoring flavors, and paying attention to body signals. Avoid restrictive dieting behaviors and prioritize overall well-being."

    {
      "title": "Regular Physical Activity",
      "description": "Continue with the current moderate-intensity workout routine, including cardio, flexibility, and recreational sports.  Progressive overload can be incorporated by gradually increasing duration or intensity of these activities.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research consistently demonstrates the benefits of regular physical activity for overall health and fitness. This approach aligns with Nishchay's preference for moderate intensity and avoids potential risks associated with high-impact activities.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Schedule workouts consistently throughout the week. Gradually increase the duration or intensity of chosen activities to promote gradual progress and prevent plateaus. Consult a qualified fitness professional for guidance on exercise technique and progression."
