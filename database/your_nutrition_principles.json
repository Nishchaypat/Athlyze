  "hydration_guidelines": {
    "daily_water_intake": "3-4 Liters",
    "timing_strategy": "Spread throughout the day, with increased intake around workouts",
    "explanation": "Adequate hydration is crucial for optimal muscle function, nutrient transport, and overall performance. Research indicates that disorders of sodium and water balance are common, highlighting the importance of consistent fluid intake. Increased intake around workouts helps replace fluids lost through sweat."
  },
  "adjustment_guidelines": {
    "weight_loss_plateau": "Increase protein intake by 10-15%, reduce carbohydrate intake by 10-15%, and/or increase cardiovascular activity.",
    "strength_plateau": "Increase carbohydrate intake by 10-15%, ensuring adequate fuel for training. Consider incorporating carbohydrate loading strategies before intense leg workouts, as research suggests this practice is common among physique competitors (83%).",
    "energy_issues": "Evaluate overall calorie intake and ensure adequate consumption. Consider increasing carbohydrate intake, particularly around workouts, to improve energy levels and training capacity. Research suggests carbohydrate restriction can negatively impact both strength performance and training capacity."

    {
      "title": "Prioritize Protein Intake",
      "description": "Consume 2.0-2.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research consistently demonstrates the direct effect of dietary protein intake on body composition in exercising individuals. Consuming a very high protein diet (4.4 g/kg/d) can further impact body composition. This intake supports muscle growth and repair, crucial for achieving Nick's goals of building leg muscles, triceps, and back.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Distribute protein intake evenly throughout the day, consuming protein-rich foods with each meal. Include sources like lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, and plant-based options like lentils and tofu."
    },
    {
      "title": "Strategic Carbohydrate Consumption",
      "description": "Moderate carbohydrate intake, focusing on complex carbohydrates and timing consumption around workouts.",
      "scientific_basis": "While carbohydrate restriction can promote fat loss, it can also hinder training capacity and muscle function due to glycogen depletion. Research shows that male weightlifters who prioritize protein and fat at the expense of carbohydrates may experience hindered training gains. Thus, a moderate approach is recommended for Nick.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Consume complex carbohydrates like brown rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, and oats primarily around workouts to fuel training sessions. Limit simple sugars and processed carbohydrates."

    {
      "title": "Monitor Body Composition",
      "description": "Track body weight and body fat percentage regularly to monitor progress and make necessary adjustments.",
      "scientific_basis": "Research highlights the importance of scheduled physique assessments and body weight averages during competition preparation. This practice allows for data-driven adjustments to nutrition and training.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Weigh yourself weekly and assess body fat percentage bi-weekly. Use this data to inform adjustments to calorie and macronutrient intake based on progress toward goals."
    },
    {
      "title": "Fat Intake Optimization",
      "description": "Consume healthy fats in moderation (20-30% of total calories) to support hormone production and overall health.",
      "scientific_basis": "While research indicates that high fat intake at the expense of carbohydrates can be detrimental, healthy fats are essential for various physiological processes.  Maintaining a moderate intake ensures adequate support for hormonal balance and overall well-being.",
      "implementation_strategy": "Include sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil in the diet. Limit saturated and trans fats."
