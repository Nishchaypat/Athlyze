  "intro": "This training plan is designed for Nick, a 23-year-old intermediate lifter, aiming to gain leg muscle, lose belly and side fat, achieve defined abs and core strength, and build triceps and a wider, thicker back.  The plan incorporates principles of progressive overload and muscle hypertrophy, focusing on compound movements and targeted exercises. Fat loss is supported through increased muscle mass, which boosts metabolism. Note that diet is crucial for fat loss and achieving visible abs. This plan is structured to promote muscle growth while considering evidence-based practices in resistance training.",
