  "intro": "This training plan is designed for Nishchay, a 22-year-old advanced lifter, focusing on maintaining general fitness, a leaner physique, and balanced conditioning rather than maximal strength or muscle hypertrophy. The plan incorporates moderate-intensity resistance training, steady-state cardio, and flexibility work, while being mindful of previous minor injuries. It emphasizes sustainable fitness habits and aligns with Nishchay's preference for a flexible diet and recreational sports. The program is structured to be adaptable and progressive, ensuring continuous improvement in overall fitness without pushing towards overtraining.",
