  "intro": "This comprehensive training plan is designed to help you achieve your goals of gaining overall body strength and muscle definition, particularly in your abs, arms, and shoulders, while reducing arm and thigh fat. It is structured around evidence-based resistance training principles and is tailored to your intermediate experience level and access to gym equipment. The plan emphasizes progressive overload, a key factor for continuous muscle growth and strength gains, while considering the importance of avoiding overtraining as highlighted in the research. This plan also assumes maintenance of your current nutritional practices, as per study protocols.",
