"intro": "This personalized diet plan is designed to help you achieve your goals of gaining strength and definition, particularly in your abs, legs, and glutes, while also reducing fat in your thighs, torso, and upper arms.  As a vegetarian, this plan focuses on plant-based protein sources to support muscle growth and recovery. It emphasizes a balanced approach to nutrition, avoiding restrictive practices to promote a healthy relationship with food and body image, in line with research highlighting the risks of disordered eating in physique-focused individuals. This plan is based on scientific evidence and tailored to your activity level and dietary preferences.",

    "daily_calories": "Approximately 1650 calories",
    "calculation_method": "Mifflin-St Jeor equation for Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and multiplied by an activity factor of 1.5 (for active individuals). A slight caloric deficit of approximately 250 calories is incorporated to support fat loss while aiming for body recomposition.",
    "adjustment_factors": "Caloric intake may need to be adjusted based on your progress and how your body responds. Monitor your weight, body measurements, and energy levels. If weight loss plateaus or you experience excessive hunger or fatigue, adjustments may be necessary. It is recommended to adjust calories in increments of 100-200 calories."

    "macronutrient_distribution": {
    "protein": "105g (approximately 1.8g per kg of body weight)",
    "carbohydrates": "185g (approximately 45% of total calories)",
    "fats": "55g (approximately 30% of total calories)",
    "explanation": "This macronutrient distribution is designed to support muscle protein synthesis for strength and definition gains while providing sufficient carbohydrates for energy during workouts and daily activities.  A moderate fat intake is essential for hormone production and overall health.  Prioritizing protein is crucial for muscle growth, especially in a vegetarian diet, and helps with satiety to manage calorie intake effectively. Research suggests adequate protein intake is vital for muscle building and repair, while balanced carbohydrates and fats support overall metabolic function and energy levels."
