  "intro": "This beginner-friendly hypertrophy training plan is designed to help you build muscle mass, focusing primarily on lower body development as per your goals. It incorporates evidence-based strategies for muscle growth, emphasizing progressive overload and proper exercise technique. The plan is structured across six training days, with a dedicated rest and recovery day to optimize muscle repair and growth. We will leverage research on muscle hypertrophy, including the importance of exercise technique, progressive overload, and muscle-specific targeting.  This plan is designed to be adaptable as you progress.",

          "scientific_explanation": "Back squats are a compound exercise that effectively targets multiple muscle groups including the quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings simultaneously. Compound exercises are crucial for overall muscle growth and strength development as they engage a larger muscle mass, leading to a greater anabolic response. Research indicates that multi-joint exercises are as effective as single-joint exercises for hypertrophy and are more time-efficient.",
