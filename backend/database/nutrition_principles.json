    "hydration_guidelines": {
      "daily_water_intake": "Consume approximately 2.5-3 liters of water per day. This is a general guideline and may need to be adjusted based on activity level, climate, and individual thirst. Since you are active, aim towards the higher end of this range, especially on workout days.",
      "timing_strategy": "Spread your water intake throughout the day rather than drinking large amounts at once. Drink a glass of water upon waking, between meals, before, during, and after workouts. Carry a water bottle with you as a reminder to drink regularly.",
      "explanation": "Adequate hydration is crucial for overall health, energy levels, and exercise performance. Water aids in nutrient transport, temperature regulation, and waste removal. For active individuals, maintaining optimal hydration is essential to support muscle function and prevent fatigue. While the research database doesn't explicitly focus on hydration, it's a fundamental aspect of any nutrition plan, particularly for athletes aiming to improve strength and body composition."

      "adjustment_guidelines": {
        "weight_loss_plateau": "If you experience a weight loss plateau (no weight change for 2-3 weeks), reassess your calorie intake and activity levels. Ensure you are accurately tracking your food and activity. Consider a slight reduction in calorie intake (around 100-200 calories) or increasing your workout intensity or duration. Given the research highlighting the risks of rigid self-monitoring, make these adjustments mindfully and focus on sustainable changes rather than drastic restrictions.  Focus on non-scale victories like strength gains and how clothes fit.",
        "strength_plateau": "If you hit a strength plateau in your workouts, review your protein intake and overall calorie intake to ensure you are providing your body with enough fuel for muscle growth and recovery. As a vegetarian, ensure you are consuming sufficient protein from sources like tofu, yogurt, lentils, and beans. Consider increasing your calorie intake slightly, focusing on nutrient-dense foods. Additionally, vary your workout routine to challenge your muscles in new ways. The research on weightlifters suggests that diets low in carbohydrates may hinder training gains, so ensure you are consuming adequate carbohydrates to fuel your workouts.",
        "energy_issues": "If you experience low energy levels, evaluate your overall calorie intake and macronutrient balance. Ensure you are consuming enough carbohydrates for energy, especially around your workouts. Iron deficiency can also cause fatigue, particularly in women. As a vegetarian, focus on iron-rich foods like lentils, spinach, and fortified cereals, and consider pairing them with vitamin C-rich foods to enhance iron absorption. If fatigue persists, consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Remember that the research highlights the potential negative impact of overly restrictive diets on athlete well-being, so prioritize balanced nutrition to support both your physical and mental energy."

      {
        "title": "Prioritize Sufficient Protein Intake for Muscle Growth and Strength",
        "description": "As a vegetarian aiming for strength and muscle definition, ensure you consume adequate protein. Aim for approximately 1.6-2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, distributed throughout your meals. Given your weight of 128 lbs (approximately 58 kg), this translates to roughly 93-128 grams of protein daily. Focus on diverse vegetarian protein sources such as tofu, tempeh, edamame, lentils, chickpeas, beans, quinoa, nuts, seeds, and Greek yogurt. Combine different protein sources to ensure you obtain all essential amino acids.",
        "scientific_basis": "Protein is crucial for muscle protein synthesis, which is essential for muscle growth and repair, especially after resistance training. While the research doesn't explicitly focus on vegetarian athletes' protein needs, the general principles of protein requirements for muscle growth apply across dietary patterns.  Ensuring sufficient protein intake is vital for achieving your strength and muscle definition goals.",
        "implementation_strategy": "Incorporate protein-rich foods into every meal and snack. For example, add tofu or lentils to your lunch and dinner, have Greek yogurt or nuts as snacks, and include protein powder in your post-workout shake if needed. Plan your meals in advance to ensure you are consistently meeting your protein targets. Track your protein intake initially to get a sense of your current consumption and adjust as needed."

        "title": "Emphasize Carbohydrates for Workout Fuel and Energy",
        "description": "Do not restrict carbohydrates, especially given your activity level and goal to gain strength. Carbohydrates are your body's primary energy source, particularly during workouts.  Focus on complex carbohydrates like whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats), fruits, vegetables, and starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, potatoes). Time your carbohydrate intake strategically, consuming more carbohydrates around your workout times to fuel your sessions and replenish glycogen stores.",
        "scientific_basis": "The research on male weightlifters suggests that diets excessively high in protein and fat at the expense of carbohydrates may hinder training gains.  Carbohydrates are essential for providing energy for high-intensity exercise and supporting muscle recovery. Adequate carbohydrate intake is crucial for optimizing your workout performance and achieving your strength goals.",
        "implementation_strategy": "Include a source of complex carbohydrates in most meals, especially breakfast and pre- and post-workout meals. Examples include oatmeal with fruit for breakfast, a sweet potato with lunch, and brown rice with dinner. Experiment with carbohydrate timing to find what works best for your energy levels and workout performance. Listen to your body and adjust your carbohydrate intake based on your training intensity and duration."
