  "intro": "This training plan is designed for a 22-year-old active female aiming to gain strength and definition, particularly in the abs and legs, and to improve glute development, while reducing fat in the thigh, torso, and upper arm regions. It utilizes bodyweight resistance training, suitable for limited gym equipment access and supported by research indicating its effectiveness for muscle gain and body composition improvement, especially for individuals in overweight/obese categories, although the principles apply broadly for strength and definition gains.",
