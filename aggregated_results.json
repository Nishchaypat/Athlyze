        "Binge eating episodes are common shortly after competition.",
        "Some athletes have regained up to 8 kg in the first 3-4 weeks following competition.",
        "Overfeeding after sustained weight loss may suppress dietary fat oxidation and cause adipocyte hyperplasia.",
        "The addition of new adipocytes increases fat storage capacity and results in smaller adipocytes that secrete less leptin.",
        "Adipocyte hyperplasia may increase the likelihood of regaining more weight than was lost (body fat overshooting).",
        "Athletes with repeated cycles of weight loss and regain tend to have a higher body mass index later in life.",
        "The early phase of weight regain is characterized by preferential gain of fat mass.",

        "Leptin and testosterone levels may not fully recover until 5-6 months post-competition, but generally trend towards pre-competition levels within this timeframe.",
        "Complete recovery of physiological parameters is typically observed 4-6 months following competition, provided the physique athlete maintains positive energy balance and regains a significant portion of the weight lost during the preparation period.",
        "The timeline of recovery would be accelerated by consumption of a larger energy surplus and a more rapid weight regain.",

        "Lean mass loss reported in female competitors is typically lower during contest preparation.",
        "Some studies of female competitors have observed either little lean mass loss during preparation or even a slight increase.",
        "The difference in lean mass loss between sexes may be due to baseline testosterone levels being higher in males, making them more responsive to the large decline in testosterone that typically occurs during contest preparation.",
        "Lean mass differences could also be due to the level of conditioning required in bodybuilders versus other physique classes.",
        "Energy availability is the primary driver of reproductive function in women.",
        "Energy availability is the difference between total energy intake and exercise energy expenditure relative to fat free mass.",
        "To prevent menstrual cycle abnormalities, female athletes are encouraged to consume at least 30 kcal/kg lean mass daily.",
        "Energy intake below 30 kcal/kg lean mass may result in several hormone-related changes, including disruption of luteinizing hormone pulsatility.",
        "Disruption of luteinizing hormone pulsatility can result in amenorrhea, a reduction in bone density and increased fracture risk.",
        "Many female competitors may need to consume fewer than 30 kcal/kg lean mass at least at some stage during contest preparation to reach competitive levels of body fat on stage.",
