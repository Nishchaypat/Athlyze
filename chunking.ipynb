      "accurate classification of the 22 participants to group e may therefore have resulted in larger differences between the subgroups. this underscores that caution should be exercised when using self-reported data for personalized services. misreporting may in general have consequences for the success of personalized nutrition programs, if these programs rely on self-reported data. in addition, an inherent limitation to the use of the bioelectrical impedance is hydration status, which may ultimately result in the misesti- mation of fat and fat-free body mass. this misestimation may be more prevalent in obese individuals due to differences in body water, relative to normal weight individuals [ 102].\n",
